2. Small Group Evaluation: Group of 8-20 learners
3. Field Trial: Conducted in actual instructional environment

## Formative Evaluation Focus Areas
- Content accuracy and appropriateness
- Learner comprehension and performance ability
- Instructional strategy effectiveness
- Material usability
- Assessment instrument suitability
