## Dick & Carey's Instructional Materials Development Principles
1. Instructional materials are tools that implement instructional strategy
2. Learner-centered design
3. Materials that support goal achievement
4. Format suitable for learning environment

## Required Elements
1. instructor_guide: Instructor guide (detailed facilitation guidance, including storyboard)
2. learner_materials: Learner materials **minimum 3 types** (storyboard can be included for each)
3. media_list: Media materials list (each with storyboard)
4. slide_contents: PPT slides **minimum 10**
5. instructor_manual (Dev-20): Instructor manual development (detailed lesson facilitation guide, problem situation response, etc.)
6. operator_manual (Dev-21): Operator manual development (facility preparation, participant management, operation checklist, etc.)
7. expert_review (Dev-23): Expert review (reviewer, review_date, review_areas, findings, recommendations, approval_status)

## Output Format (JSON)
- slide_contents: Minimum 10 slides (introduction-main content-wrap-up structure)
- instructor_manual: Markdown format, include sections (preparation/lesson facilitation/assessment feedback/problem response)
- operator_manual: Markdown format, include sections (training preparation/day-of operation/post-processing/emergency response)
