  "title": "Large-Scale 4C/ID Model-Based Dental Education Course for Improving Clinical Reasoning and Scientific Inquiry Skills",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Elementary dental science knowledge, comprehension of patient care procedures, and basic competency in scientific methodology (experiment design and data analysis)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "An educational process where medium-sized learner groups repeatedly perform tasks resembling actual clinical scenarios in constrained technological environments (no PC access, smartphone-based), receiving feedback. Learners experience the scientific inquiry process through observational recording, symptom analysis, and treatment outcome measurement.",
    "institution_type": "Public/Non-profit educational institution",
    "learner_age": "In their 20s",
    "learner_education": "Elementary",
    "learner_role": "Student",
    "domain_expertise": "Beginner"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners apply systematic clinical reasoning processes with 80% accuracy in situations similar to actual dental cases and establish diagnostic hypotheses based on scientific evidence.",
    "Learners can decompose complex cases into three stages (observation-hypothesis formulation-variable analysis) and utilize strategies to manage cognitive load.",
    "Learners correct at least 70% of their clinical judgment errors based on peer evaluations and instructor feedback and propose new treatment protocols through error analysis."
