  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic remote education operation experience and fundamental language education concepts (four core domains: reading, writing, listening, speaking; grammar systems; vocabulary acquisition principles; communication strategies; text analysis; accuracy of expression; pronunciation accuracy). Possession of basic VR environment manipulation skills.",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Simulation/VR-based",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Providing a simulation learning environment for workplace language competency enhancement targeting working professionals. VR scenarios reflecting real business situations (meetings, presentations, negotiations) and a customized feedback system. Integration with AI-based assessment tools that analyze learners' text generation, vocabulary selection, pronunciation accuracy, and grammatical errors in real time. Offers personalized vocabulary recommendations and expression accuracy improvement strategies based on learning data. Includes dynamic content adjustment reflecting learners' communication strategy usage and text analysis results.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners analyze 5 key trends in distance education research (digital literacy, interactivity, self-directed learning, multimedia utilization, data-driven assessment) and apply them to language learning design (grammar systems, vocabulary acquisition principles, communication strategies, text analysis, expression accuracy).",
    "Learners evaluate and compare 3 language education design models (task-based, content-based, communication-based) in VR simulations, analyzing their impact on the four language skills (reading, writing, listening, speaking) and expression accuracy, vocabulary usage patterns, and pronunciation accuracy.",
    "By the end of the 4-week course, learners analyze provided research data (10 surveys, 15 learning logs) to perform the following for 3 language learner types (beginner/intermediate/advanced): 1) Select one language analysis software (e.g., ELPA, Text Inspector) and one customized activity (e.g., vocabulary expansion game, pronunciation practice, scenario-based dialogue simulation) per type; 2) Propose a learning design plan scoring ≥70/100 on a rubric (suitability 40%, feasibility 30%, creativity 30%); 3) Submit a proposal including evaluation metrics for text analysis, vocabulary patterns, expression accuracy, and pronunciation."
