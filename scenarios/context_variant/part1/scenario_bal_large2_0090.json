  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Possession of basic educational methodologies and language teaching experience (grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension instruction, etc.)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Specific analysis of learner resistance (e.g., speaking avoidance, writing burden) occurring when applying activity-based language teaching methods in online environments and exploration of response strategies.",
    "institution_type": "Vocational training institution",
    "learner_age": "In their 30s",
    "learner_education": "University",
    "learner_role": "Office worker (administrative/management)",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can analyze at least three root causes of negative perceptions toward active language learning (e.g., grammar-centered education experiences, expression anxiety).",
    "Learners can apply five classroom management strategies (e.g., vocabulary expansion activities, text-based discussion facilitation) to real language education cases to mitigate learner resistance.",
    "Learners can develop and pilot a three-stage framework (preparation-execution-reflection) for designing language collaborative activities (e.g., role-playing, writing feedback) in online environments."
