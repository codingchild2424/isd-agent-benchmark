  "title": "[Large-Scale] Academic Library Information Search Education: Strategies for Improving Effectiveness of Social Science Research Materials (Integrating Information Literacy and Social System/Relationship Analysis for Civic Competency Enhancement)",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic smartphone usage understanding, general information retrieval experience, elementary grasp of social science research methodologies (e.g., topic selection, data collection, civic engagement analysis), and recognition of core academic vocabulary for literature searches (civic engagement, institutional analysis, cultural studies, political relations, economic inequality, etc.)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learners primarily access the LMS via smartphones, requiring self-directed learning in non-real-time environments. Educational materials must be provided in mobile-friendly formats, including customized search strategies for social science researchers/learners (e.g., academic term mapping, interdisciplinary resource integration, connecting concepts across history/geography/economics/politics). Particularly emphasizes public data access methods (government data portals, community reports) for civic engagement and comparative research filtering for social system analysis.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners interpret document-based resources explaining academic library database search procedures with ≥80% accuracy and apply selection criteria (scholarly validity, source credibility, political/economic context reflection) for social science topics (e.g., cultural comparison, institutional analysis).",
    "Learners successfully search for academic materials on a social science topic (e.g., economic inequality, political relations, civic rights) ≥3 times using a provided guide and explain evaluation methods (author expertise, publication date, peer review, cultural bias).",
    "Learners document ≥3 specific cases of using document-based guides (library manuals, online FAQs) in a reflective journal over a week, proposing ≥2 improvements per case (e.g., keyword optimization, interdisciplinary resource strategies, historical/geographical data integration) and verifying compliance with social science research ethics (citation, copyright, participant rights)."
