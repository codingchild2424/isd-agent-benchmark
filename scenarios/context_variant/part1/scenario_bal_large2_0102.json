  "title": "[Large-Scale] Vocational Language Communication Blended Learning Program for Students with Disabilities: Integrated Training in Job Contexts, Vocabulary, Grammar, and Communication Strategies",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic job competencies, online learning platform usage experience, foundational workplace grammar (sentence structure, tenses, honorifics) and business document (official documents, emails) reading skills, understanding of job-related vocabulary (workplace terminology, situational expressions), digital tool utilization experience.",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Combining work-based learning (WBL) with blended instructional design to improve job-related language skills (expression, reading comprehension, contextual understanding) and social integration for students with disabilities. It measures practical competencies through project-based assessments and applies a BYOD environment. A personalized feedback system is established to enhance learners' expressive skills (sentence completeness, vocabulary diversity) and reading comprehension (contextual inference, key information extraction). It integrates language support strategies for different disability types (visual/auditory aids) and strengthens global competencies through multilingual document translation training.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners with disabilities can perform basic workplace communication skills (e.g., email writing, business report writing) with over 80% accuracy, use professional vocabulary and complex grammatical structures (conjunctions, tenses, honorifics) appropriate to job contexts, and aim to enhance expressiveness through idiom interpretation and synonym utilization.",
    "In a 3-person team-based project, learners can complete two multilingual document translation scenarios (marketing report, contract translation) for a global company. They must achieve four or more of five team collaboration checklist items (role division, schedule adherence, communication, feedback incorporation, final review) and two or more of three problem-solving evaluation items (problem identification, alternative suggestions, feasibility) within a week. The final output must include over 90% translation accuracy, contextually clear expressions (using synonyms three or more times, accurately interpreting two or more idioms), and receive a comprehensive evaluation of reading comprehension and writing skills.",
    "Learners can autonomously complete job-related tasks using digital tools (word processors, video conferencing systems) and apply effective listening (note-taking, capturing key terms) and speaking strategies (clear pronunciation, logical structuring, honorifics) during video conferences to simultaneously improve listening comprehension and expressive abilities."
