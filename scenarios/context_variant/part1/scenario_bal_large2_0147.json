  "learning_goals": [
    "In a simulated environment, learners identify and explain four major cognitive biases (momentum, confirmation, probability calculation, sequence effects) within social relational contexts.",
    "When biases occur, learners implement recovery strategies that integrate critical thinking and civic awareness to correct decision-making errors by at least 70%.",
    "During debriefing, learners engage at least 80% in peer feedback and self-reflection using bias-resistant frameworks, exploring ways to promote civic rights in educational settings."
