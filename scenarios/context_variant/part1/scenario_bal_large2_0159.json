  "title": "Digital-Based Language Expertise Development: Strengthening Practical Competencies via MOOCs (Integrating Text Analysis, Writing, Translation, and Applying Scientific Inquiry Methods)",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic experience with digital learning tools (video conferencing, online collaboration platforms) and beginner-level language skills (grammar/vocabulary comprehension, basic text interpretation). Additionally requires foundational understanding of scientific inquiry methods (observation, hypothesis formulation, variable control)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Most learners are novices with less than three years of language-related job experience, requiring simultaneous adaptation to digital learning environments and strengthening practical competencies in text analysis, writing, and translation. Particularly, improvement in scientific inquiry methods and evidence-based analysis considering diverse linguistic variables (dialects, writing styles, cultural implications) is needed. The learning process emphasizes the collection of measurable evidence (translation accuracy rates, vocabulary frequency, etc.).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can explain the process of developing and sharing language learning materials (text analysis worksheets, translation guidelines, etc.) using digital tools (Notion, Google Docs) through three or more scientific inquiry methods (hypothesis setting-variable control-evidence collection). Emphasis is placed on experimental designs systematically controlling linguistic variables (vocabulary selection, sentence structure, cultural context).",
    "While collaborating on MOOC platform tasks (joint translation projects, grammar reviews), learners can complete practical documents (translation reports, linguistic analysis materials) reflecting peer feedback and derive logical conclusions from analysis results. Evidence-based conclusions must be presented applying evaluation criteria for text coherence and appropriateness of expression.",
    "Within one week, learners can systematically organize language proficiency development achievements (two translation projects, language test score improvements, vocabulary acquisition status) in a digital portfolio and submit results meeting four or more of the five pre-provided evaluation checklist items (grammar accuracy, text coherence, vocabulary diversity, appropriateness of expression, cultural context reflection). The portfolio must include graphs and analytical evidence showing vocabulary acquisition trends."
