    "Learners perform the role of Knowledge Integrator in structured argumentative discussions on controversial topics, demonstrating logical expression and critical reading skills.",
    "Learners implement interaction patterns of a Discussion Facilitator (e.g., prompting questions, summarizing perspectives, refining vocabulary) with 80% accuracy in three or more argumentative discussions.",
    "Learners analyze the correlation between individual argumentative contribution (Viewpoint Contributor) and group performance to design optimal text-based participation strategies."
