  "learning_goals": [
    "Applying mixed research methods (quantitative/qualitative), learners will analyze factors influencing e-learning technology adoption in social studies education (cultural context, civic engagement, etc.).",
    "Learners will connect the seven core factors (usefulness, ease of use, self-efficacy, etc.) derived from the FROG VLE case to social studies education contexts (e.g., integrated history-geography lesson design).",
    "Learners will derive adoption factors specialized for social studies education (e.g., local community problem-solving) when designing mobile microlearning in limited technological environments."
