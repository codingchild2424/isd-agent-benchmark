    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can analyze collaborative learning log data to evaluate individual linguistic contributions (discussion participation, lexical diversity, etc.) within a team with 80% accuracy.",
    "Learners can reflect on their communication patterns (speaking/listening strategies, feedback expressions, etc.) based on analysis results and develop a language expression improvement plan.",
    "Learners can improve verbal collaboration efficiency (communication clarity, discussion structuring, etc.) by over 25% through at least three data-driven feedback sessions during a team project."
