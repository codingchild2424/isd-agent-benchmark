  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will enhance expressive skills (speaking/writing) and integrated text/image comprehension by designing language learning scenarios and dialogues using the three-act narrative structure of filmmaking.",
    "Learners will develop narrative-based dialogue content (integrating grammar/vocabulary with cultural context) to motivate language learning by applying character arc techniques.",
    "Using smartphone filming/editing tools (CapCut, Canva), learners will produce ≥3 visual storytelling contents and develop 1 integrated language education module combining text-image techniques. The module must achieve 'B+' or higher in ≥4 of 5 institutional rubric criteria (content organization, tech utilization, educational effectiveness, cultural relevance, learner engagement)."
