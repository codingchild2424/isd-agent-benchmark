    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational nursing knowledge, patient counseling experience, and understanding of basic vocabulary and grammatical structures required in medical settings",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A training course where pre-service teachers use smartphone apps to practice CAM (Complementary and Alternative Medicine)-related communication skills via virtual patient scenarios. Emphasizes improving linguistic accuracy and context-appropriate expression through text-based dialogue analysis and speech evaluation.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners listen to a virtual patient’s concerns about CAM (Complementary and Alternative Medicine) use in a simulation environment and provide appropriate feedback with empathetic expressions and clear vocabulary choices.",
    "Learners develop strategies for educating patients on CAM use based on risk-benefit assessments and cultivate the ability to translate complex medical information into everyday language.",
    "Learners improve communication self-efficacy by 20% or more through simulation result analysis and identify effective expression strategies in patient-doctor dialogue transcripts."
