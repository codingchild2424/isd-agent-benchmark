    "Participants can apply technical competencies (video conferencing tools, real-time interaction management) with 80%+ accuracy in synchronous online language classes to enhance learners’ speaking/listening skills.",
    "Participants can produce one+ language lesson designs improved through peer feedback and self-reflection, focusing on social competencies (learning atmosphere creation, cultural sensitivity), including text-based activities and vocabulary expansion strategies.",
    "Participants can analyze real language class cases to derive three+ improvement strategies (e.g., grammar explanation methods, reading activity diversification, expressive fluency enhancement) and implement them in simulated lessons."
