  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic construction site workflows, familiarity with safety-related technical terminology, basic smartphone functionality, experience with simple data visualization tools, and foundational technical report writing/reading skills",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Hands-on training using smartphone sensors, emphasizing enhanced safety management capabilities in non-face-to-face environments and fostering clear communication (expression/reading comprehension) skills among workers. It includes language-based communication scenarios such as technical report writing, on-site instruction interpretation, and safety meeting presentations. Learners are evaluated on their oral/written communication skills using professional terminology, with validation of applicability in real work environments.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can identify four major risk factors (chemical exposure, equipment collisions, falling objects, electric shocks) in construction material handling tasks with 80% accuracy and clearly describe them in safety reports using technical vocabulary. Specifically, risk factors must be systematically documented using professional terms such as \"risk identification,\" \"risk assessment,\" and \"risk mitigation.\"",
    "Learners can preprocess smartphone accelerometer/gyroscope sensor data (3-axis acceleration, angular velocity) to implement a machine learning model (Random Forest or SVM) that classifies at least three risk scenarios (falls, collisions, slips), measure the model’s accuracy (≥85%), precision (≥80%), and recall (≥75%), and explain results orally/written using technical terms (feature extraction, cross-validation, F1-score). Additionally, model interpretations must be translated into linguistic expressions aligned with safety protocols.",
    "Learners can execute risk prevention measures in real work environments through a three-stage process (awareness-analysis-response), effectively communicating each stage orally/written using professional terms based on safety protocols (e.g., \"risk identification,\" \"risk assessment,\" \"risk mitigation\"). Technical vocabulary and clear expressions must be utilized during on-site instruction interpretation and safety meeting presentations."
