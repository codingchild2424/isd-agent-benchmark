  "learning_goals": [
    "Preservice teachers can design instructional strategies using CAPs to improve the understanding of math concepts (equations, graphs, statistics) by 20% or more for students with special needs.",
    "Learners can apply math formulas and problem-solving strategies acquired through CAPs in VR simulations to execute three or more differentiated math teaching methods (visual modeling, step-by-step problem-solving, real-world connections).",
    "Participants can propose two or more strategies to enhance student engagement (collaborative learning, personalized feedback, gamification elements) in their CAPs-based lessons through peer evaluation."
