  "title": "[Large-Scale] Exploring the Effects of Inquiry-Based Language-Integrated Learning in Science Education: Instructional Design Strategies for Pre-Service Teachers",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Core knowledge of science curricula, foundational understanding of educational science principles, and competencies in academic writing and scientific communication",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course designed for pre-service teachers to understand inquiry-based learning strategies applicable in elementary and secondary science classrooms and to implement confirmatory and structured inquiry methods in real educational settings. Enables self-directed learning using personal devices in an online asynchronous environment, with a strong emphasis on integrated language skills (reading, writing, speaking, listening) required in the scientific inquiry process.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Preservice teachers can explain the differences between confirmatory and structured inquiry using scientific terminology and linguistic expressions, and write a comparative report analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of each.",
    "Based on expectancy-value theory, preservice teachers can assess how inquiry-based learning affects learners’ success expectations and intrinsic values from the perspective of linguistic interaction.",
    "Preservice teachers can design non-face-to-face inquiry-based science lessons in an LMS environment and monitor learners’ linguistic expression skills and participation using formative assessment tools (e.g., discussion boards, reflection journals)."
