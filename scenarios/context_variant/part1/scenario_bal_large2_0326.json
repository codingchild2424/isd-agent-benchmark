  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic PowerPoint proficiency, secondary mathematics teaching experience (functions, calculus, statistics units), understanding of mathematical symbols (Σ/∫/Δ) and graph representation methods (coordinate systems/trend lines), comprehension of basic statistical concepts (mean/variance/standard deviation) and probability distributions",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A program for corporate math trainers to recognize PowerPoint pedagogy effectiveness and develop learner engagement strategies (e.g., visual proofs via graph-based limit explanations, data-driven design using correlation coefficient visualizations). Focuses on intuitive delivery tools for complex math concepts (differential equations, matrix operations, probability distributions), including visual representations of statistical analysis (regression/hypothesis testing) and proof processes (mathematical induction/limit proofs).",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can recognize the functional limitations of PowerPoint (e.g., excessive text copying, rapid pacing) and explain at least three learner-friendly slide design standards (e.g., visualizing formulas with LaTeX, optimizing graphs (axis labels/units), applying step-by-step animations (segmenting differentiation processes)).",
    "When explaining math concepts (e.g., functions (continuity/differentiability), calculus (limits/integration), statistics (variance/regression analysis)), learners can design instructional materials using at least three visual elements (diagrams/charts, animations (visualizing proof processes), interactive elements (quizzes for probability problems)) and demonstrate the ability to achieve an average score of 4 or higher on a 5-point scale in peer reviews and expert evaluations.",
    "Learners can collect PowerPoint usage data using a mixed-methods approach (100 quantitative surveys (5-point Likert scale) + 10 qualitative interviews (thematic analysis)), perform statistical analyses (mean/variance/correlation (Pearson’s r)), and develop an action plan including at least three improvement strategies (e.g., graph resolution enhancement, animation speed adjustment, formula font standardization) and a 3-month implementation timeline."
