    "prior_knowledge": "Basic computer literacy, high school mathematics education experience, understanding of core mathematical concepts (functions, geometry, statistics), ability to apply mathematical variables and formulas, and foundational skills in statistical analysis and graph interpretation",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",

    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Emphasizes ICT tools (GeoGebra, Desmos, Wolfram Alpha) and reflective practice in mathematics education, focusing on higher-order thinking skills such as digital mathematical modeling, data analysis, and proof visualization. Learners apply scientific inquiry methods to analyze mathematical problems, interpret results using graphing and statistical tools, and perform logical error verification and statistical significance evaluation in proofs.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can design interactive math lessons (80% completion) using digital tools like GeoGebra or Desmos, visualizing function graphs, modeling equations, and analyzing data while clearly expressing relationships between variables and formulas.",
    "When designing ICT-based math learning activities, learners must explain three or more connections between educational objectives (e.g., visualizing geometric proofs), tools (e.g., GeoGebra dynamic geometry), and content (e.g., Pythagorean theorem proofs). They must include mathematical evidence presentation, emphasizing logical consistency and statistical validity in proofs.",
    "Learners can select two ICT strategies (e.g., real-time screen sharing + digital pen annotations for proof marking, Mentimeter surveys for immediate concept comprehension assessment) on platforms like Zoom or Webex. Applying these three or more times, they can achieve 80%+ learner comprehension, including statistical analysis of understanding using probability distributions and confidence intervals."
