  "title": "[Large-Scale] Technology-Based Language Learning Strategy Design for Adolescents: Integrated Reading, Writing, and Expression Approach with Digital Communication Analysis and Assessment Framework",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational language education theories (grammar systems, vocabulary expansion strategies, text analysis methodologies, expression strategy design) and experience operating online learning platforms, understanding of adolescent language use in digital contexts (emoji usage, abbreviation creation, informal expressions), and familiarity with CEFR-based language proficiency assessment methods.",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A language education program for adolescents optimized for smartphone-based learning environments, focusing on designing interactive structures using instant messaging. Particularly emphasizes analyzing adolescents’ everyday language use (chat logs, SNS posts, multimedia content) to connect it with formal language proficiency (academic writing, critical reading, creative expression). Stresses integrated development of digital literacy and language skills, including data-driven personalized learning path design. Also addresses ethical considerations (privacy protection, digital safety) in adolescent education.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can analyze digital communication patterns of adolescents (e.g., emoji usage, abbreviations, sentence structures) and design three or more technology-based interactive models applicable to language learning, such as text structure analysis, vocabulary expansion strategies, grammar correction algorithms, and expression diversification techniques.",
    "Learners can build and operate a real-time feedback system in LMS environments using instant messaging tools, incorporating features like grammar checkers, vocabulary recommendation engines, expression diversification modules, and context-based sentence restructuring.",
    "Learners can analyze three case studies of technology-based language learning processes, measure metrics such as (1) dialogue frequency (≥5 times/hour), (2) text complexity (≥CEFR B1), and (3) feedback response rate (≥80% within 72 hours), and propose five or more evaluation criteria based on these metrics: reading accuracy (≥90%), writing fluency (≥12 words/minute), communication efficiency (≥85% task completion), lexical diversity (≥50 unique words), and grammatical accuracy (<5% error rate). Additionally, they can suggest personalized learning pathways (e.g., individual vocabulary reinforcement, grammar-focused training, expression expansion modules) based on assessment results."
