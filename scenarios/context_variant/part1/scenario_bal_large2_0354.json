  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will appropriately use various digital communication tools with instructors to resolve language-related issues (grammar errors, vocabulary choices, clarity of expression) that arise during project progress.",
    "Through reflective reviews, learners will analyze the strengths and weaknesses of communication channels (text-based vs. voice-based) and select optimal tools for specific language learning contexts (e.g., writing feedback, oral presentation preparation).",
    "Learners will document knowledge-building processes (collaborative text creation, feedback exchange) with peers and instructors using digital collaboration tools and produce feedback-reflected deliverables (e-portfolios)."
