  "title": "[Large-scale] Differentiated Language Lesson Design for Enhancing Metacognition and Self-Efficacy: Integrated Strengthening of Text Analysis, Expression Strategies, and Grammar",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic language skills (reading, writing, grammar, vocabulary), experience using online learning tools, understanding of practical language instruction cases in elementary education settings, and familiarity with basic concepts of metacognitive strategies (planning, monitoring, evaluation)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A program aimed at strengthening language instruction competencies required in elementary education settings for professional practitioners. It focuses on comprehensively improving learners' reading comprehension (text structure analysis, inference), expressive abilities (creative writing, genre application), and grammar application skills (accuracy evaluation, error correction). It emphasizes fostering self-directed learning through metacognitive strategies. Notably, it establishes an objective growth measurement system through personalized feedback and rubric-based assessments.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Using metacognitive strategies for differentiated instruction, learners can analyze complex text structures (narrative, expository, argumentative) and apply advanced vocabulary (academic/abstract terms) expansion strategies at ≥80% accuracy.",
    "Learners improve their self-efficacy scores by over 20% through pre- and post-tests, enhancing confidence in integrated activities of writing (creative composition), reading comprehension (deep interpretation), and grammar (accuracy verification).",
    "Learners comprehensively improve language proficiency by achieving over 80% accuracy in a 10-item grammar error diagnosis test within a week, scoring an average of 3.5 or higher on a 4-point scale for text interpretation assessments (5 passages), and earning an \"excellent\" grade in at least three of five rubric criteria (organization, logical coherence, vocabulary, grammar, creativity) for a creative expression task (one essay)."
