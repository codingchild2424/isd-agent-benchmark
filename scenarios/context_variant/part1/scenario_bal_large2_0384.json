  "title": "[Large-scale] Project-Based Practical Math Education Design for HRD Professionals' Competency Development: Strengthening Data Analysis and Statistical Modeling",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic mathematics knowledge (algebra, geometry, elementary statistics) and HRD fundamentals. Requires foundational proficiency in function concepts, graph interpretation, probability distributions, hypothesis testing. Familiarity with matrix operations and basic calculus concepts recommended",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Aimed at strengthening HRD competencies specialized in the mathematics domain, supporting learners in developing education design capabilities applicable to actual corporate environments. Special emphasis is placed on data-driven decision-making, mathematical modeling (optimization problems, predictive models), and statistical reasoning (hypothesis testing, confidence intervals). Includes case studies applying mathematical approaches to HRD scenarios (e.g., education effectiveness measurement, workforce planning) in education design. Learners are also exposed to advanced techniques like logical development through mathematical proofs and network analysis using graph theory.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Develop competencies to systematically analyze and interpret HRD job requirement-derived math content (linear/nonlinear equations, function graphs, descriptive and inferential statistics).",
    "Enhance the ability to design customized math education projects (data visualization, probability distribution modeling, regression analysis) using LMS and technological tools (Excel, Python, R).",
    "Corporate managers/leaders achieve the following over a 4-week math education module using real business data (sales, inventory, customer satisfaction): 1) write two analytical reports applying three data analysis techniques (mean, standard deviation, Pearson correlation coefficient), 2) propose two decision-making scenarios (e.g., inventory optimization, customer retention strategies) based on analysis, and 3) build a predictive model (e.g., quarterly sales forecast) using simple/multiple regression analysis with an R² value of 0.7 or higher."
