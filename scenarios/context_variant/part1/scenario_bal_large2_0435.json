  "learning_goals": [
    "Analyze learner data (reading/writing frequency, vocabulary usage patterns) to derive three instructional design strategies that improve language learning outcomes by ≥20%.",
    "Design SNS-based collaborative learning activities to achieve ≥5 weekly interactions for text sharing and feedback among learners.",
    "Use simple data visualization tools (smartphone apps) to analyze individual learners’ vocabulary acquisition and grammatical error patterns, generating customized feedback reports."
