  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic instructional design experience, understanding of multicultural education, second language acquisition theories (Krashen’s Input Hypothesis, Interaction Hypothesis, etc.), second language teaching experience, comprehension of CEFR standards, and foundational awareness of refugee children’s emotional needs (trauma recognition)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course for language education professionals to acquire student-led language pedagogy (integrating reading/writing/speaking) immediately applicable in refugee children's education. Emphasizes vocabulary expansion (daily/academic/emotional lexicon stratification) and expressive skills development (contextual language use training) considering cultural background differences. Applies the CARE methodology (Cultural Awareness, Responsive Environment, Engagement, Reflective Practice). Particularly includes scaffolding strategies leveraging learners' native language resources for \"Responsive Environment\" and self-assessment tool development through \"Reflective Practice.\"",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Within one week, design three student-led integrated reading-writing-speaking activities (e.g., role-play dialogues, emotion diary sharing, collaborative picture book creation) reflecting refugee children’s socio-emotional needs (anxiety reduction, belonging) and CEFR A1-B1 language proficiency. Achieve an average of 2.5 or higher (3-point scale) in peer assessment, considering culturally contextualized vocabulary (daily/emotional vocabulary stratification) and expressive diversity (contextual language use).",
    "Develop and evaluate refugee-responsive language education scenarios based on the CARE methodology (cultural appropriateness, language acquisition theory application, learner engagement). Analyze transferability between learners’ native languages and target languages through Cultural Awareness and Reflective Practice.",
    "Complete one integrated language learning project (writing-reading-speaking) for refugee children within a week using online/offline collaboration tools (e.g., Padlet, Google Docs) and achieve ‘excellent’ ratings in four or more of five peer assessment rubric items (grammar accuracy, vocabulary diversity, expressiveness, cultural appropriateness, creativity). Especially evaluate high-frequency vocabulary for emotional expression and context-appropriate speech acts (speaking skills)."
