    "Learners, in 4-member teams, design a draft evaluation indicator system for vocational training programs through PBL (Problem-Based Learning) activities. They submit a result meeting ≥4 of 5 rubric criteria (clarity, measurability, feasibility, relevance, time constraints) within 5 days.",
    "Learners design a process to collect and analyze ≥3 types of indoor/outdoor environmental data (temperature, humidity, illuminance) ≥5 times within a week using Google Forms, SensorLog app, and a basic sensor kit. They generate two visualization types (bar graphs, tables) and write a report applying ≥3 data error verification criteria (e.g., time consistency, unit uniformity, outlier checks).",
    "Learners complete an educational activity evaluation system prototype using Figma or low-code tools (e.g., Bubble, Adalo) within a week. The prototype includes data input, automated scoring (≥90% accuracy), and visualization report generation, passing ≥2 of 3 predefined user scenarios. Evaluation uses a rubric: functionality (40%), scenario pass rate (40%), UI/UX suitability (20%)."
