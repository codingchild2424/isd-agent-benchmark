  "title": "[Large-scale] Evidence-Based Language Teaching Methodology Workshop for Integrating Biomedical Engineering Curricula",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic engineering and life sciences knowledge, foundational instructional design concepts, academic text comprehension and scholarly expression skills",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Participants engage to strengthen curriculum design competencies reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of biomedical engineering. Special emphasis is placed on bridging education-practice gaps by reinforcing language education elements like terminology systematization, technical documentation writing, and oral presentation training.",
    "institution_type": "Public/Non-profit educational institution",
    "learner_age": "40s and above",
    "learner_education": "University",
    "learner_role": "Professional (medical/legal/technical)",
    "domain_expertise": "Beginner"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Participants can design one language learning module reflecting biomedical engineering practice cases (including text analysis, technical terminology explanations) using evidence-based teaching methods.",
    "Participants can explain three or more language education strategies for integrating multidisciplinary knowledge (e.g., vocabulary expansion, concept explanations, reading-writing integrated activities).",
    "Participants can develop project-based assessment tools (e.g., portfolios, oral presentations, writing assignments) to measure learner language outcomes as quantifiable metrics."
