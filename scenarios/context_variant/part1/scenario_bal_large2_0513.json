  "title": "[Large-Scale] Game-Based Scientific Inquiry Workshop for Designing Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) Activities: Variable Control and Evidence-Based Experimental Design",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Fundamental digital tool utilization skills and advanced scientific expertise. Requires understanding of scientific methodologies (hypothesis formulation, experimental design, data analysis, variable control), basic experience in observation, measurement, and analysis processes. Additionally, demands experimental data visualization and scientific evidence interpretation capabilities.",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Conducted in a limited technological environment centered on smartphones, participants focus on designing TEL scenarios applicable to real science education settings. Particularly explores methods to gamify the observation, measurement, and analysis processes with low-cost, high-efficiency science inquiry activity designs (quests, scoring systems, feedback loops). All designs must include scientific evidence collection and conclusion-drawing processes, as well as methods to verify the reproducibility and validity of experimental results.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Participants can concretely design technology-enhanced science learning scenarios through game-based activities, particularly developing inquiry-based learning scenarios that include control of independent/dependent variables and reproducible experimental designs.",
    "In groups of 3–4, participants convert one provided science learning scenario into an explicit learning design (including one scientific inquiry objective, two measurable activities, and three evidence-based evaluation criteria) within three hours, achieve a rating of \"satisfactory\" or higher in at least four out of five peer evaluation rubric items, and validate experimental results' validity through hypothesis testing and data analysis methods.",
    "Participants submit a TEL (Technology-Enhanced Learning) activity plan as a project deliverable executable in limited technological environments. The plan must produce observable learning outcomes (with measurable evidence) in real science education settings and derive scientific conclusions through quantitative and qualitative analysis of experimental results."
