  "title": "[Large-Scale] Rural University Virtual Synchronous Continuous Professional Development (CPD) Science Inquiry Webinar Course: Virtual Experiments and Evidence-Based Analysis",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic science knowledge (experimental design, data interpretation, variable control) and entry-level expertise in relevant fields (medical/legal/technical). Fundamental understanding of the scientific inquiry process (hypothesis-experiment-analysis-conclusion) and experience using experimental measurement tools",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Non-degree adult learners in rural areas with low-spec internet/BYOD conditions. Webinar-based short-term intensive courses addressing post-COVID remote education needs. Includes virtual lab simulations (variable manipulation, result prediction) and evidence-based discussions (data comparison, peer verification) to strengthen scientific inquiry. Learners solve real-world cases using scientific analysis tools (graph generators, statistical calculators)",
    "institution_type": "Vocational training institution",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Participants can systematically explain three latest research trends in science (e.g., climate change modeling, gene-editing technology, nanomaterial development) alongside scientific inquiry methodologies (hypothesis setting, controlling independent/dependent variables, optimizing experimental design) through webinar participation.",
    "Participants utilize real-time interaction features (chat, polls, etc.) of webinars via mobile devices with over 90% engagement and actively participate in data collection processes for scientific hypothesis verification (quantitative observation recording, digital measurement tools).",
    "Within one week, participants complete a project-based assessment, submitting a 3-page case report applying scientific knowledge acquired from webinars (experimental design, statistical data analysis, evidence-based conclusions) to one of their professional fields (medical/legal/technical). The report must include three or more evidence materials (experiment records, data visualization graphs, field application photos, etc.)."
