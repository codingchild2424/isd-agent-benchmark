  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can simulate physics and chemistry concepts in a 3D virtual environment using VR tools, manipulate variables, and verify hypotheses.",
    "Learners can propose ≥3 curriculum integration strategies for VR-based educational tools and suggest designs based on the scientific inquiry process (observation-hypothesis-experiment-analysis-conclusion).",
    "Learners can design activities to improve students' executive functions (attention, decision-making) and scientific thinking in virtual reality environments."
