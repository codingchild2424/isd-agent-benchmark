    "Learners can collect, refine, and visualize tourism data to analyze key trend patterns.",
    "Learners will use Python-based AI analysis models (e.g., LSTM, ARIMA) to predict monthly tourist demand at tourist attractions with over 85% accuracy, propose at least three resource allocation plans (staffing/facilities) based on predictions, and explain these plans with an average score of 4 or higher on a 5-point training institution rubric (accuracy, feasibility, cost-effectiveness)",
    "Learners will analyze tourism big data (visitor counts, SNS responses, booking patterns) using Python (Pandas, NumPy) and Tableau, and create a proposal document suggesting at least three data-driven tourism marketing strategies (e.g., targeted advertising, customized package offers)",
    "Learners will understand three AI analysis techniques—data masking, anonymization, and differential privacy—and apply at least two to real datasets to produce analysis results compliant with GDPR standards at over 90%"
