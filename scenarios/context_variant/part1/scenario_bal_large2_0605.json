  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic STEM concept comprehension, comparative analysis methodology mastery, language analysis skills (grammatical structure understanding, text interpretation, vocabulary application, cultural context awareness), foundational understanding of scientific inquiry process (observation-hypothesis-experiment-conclusion) and experimental design ability",

    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Blended learning combining digital and analog activities in a BYOD environment, focusing on collaborative problem-solving through group work. Language-centered activities—such as discussions, report writing, feedback exchange, and expression refinement—are emphasized to develop learners' reading comprehension (deep text analysis) and expressive skills (multi-genre writing and presentations). Particularly, it systematically integrates scientific inquiry with language expression, linking observation-analysis-conclusion processes.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will design Hypothetical Learning Trajectories (HLT) for comparative problem-solving in STEM-integrated environments, apply scientific inquiry methods (hypothesis setting-variable control-evidence collection) to language learning activities (vocabulary analysis, text comparison, grammar structure interpretation), and derive evidence-based conclusions.",
    "Learners will iteratively improve a specific language learning activity (e.g., vocabulary games, writing feedback system, expressive skills workshop) ≥2 times using the DDR methodology’s 4 stages (design-development-implementation-evaluation), submit artifacts (design document, implementation records, evaluation report) per stage, and logically structure an improvement plan reflecting ≥2 of 3 peer/instructor feedback items in the final evaluation.",
    "Learners will systematically solve real-life problems through quantitative/qualitative comparative analysis (text analysis, data visualization, cultural context consideration), strengthen language expression (integrated speaking/writing) and logical structuring abilities (text organization, argument construction), and present clear conclusions."
