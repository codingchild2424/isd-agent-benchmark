    "Learners must apply the 5-stage flipped learning design model (goal setting, material development, activity design, feedback system, assessment method) to a mechanical engineering project, develop an instructional design framework meeting ≥8 of 10 instructor checklist items within one week (5 days), and achieve ≥80% suitability in peer and expert reviews.",
    "Data-driven learning design strategies for analyzing learner engagement can be conceptualized",
    "Graduate students must design a one-week learning activity using mobile-optimized microlearning content (3×5-minute videos + 5 quiz questions), including pre-learning (correct ≥7 of 10 diagnostic quiz questions) and post-learning (solve ≥2 of 3 scenario-based tasks). The design must meet rubric criteria (5-point scale, ≥4 points).",
    "Within one week, learners must use formative assessment tools (5-question quiz + concept map) to collect understanding data (≥80% response rate, 10-sample) on molecular structures, analyze results (misconception frequency, correct answer distribution), and propose ≥3 personalized feedback strategies (e.g., misconception correction, advanced material recommendations, peer learning groups). They must submit a system design plan (≤5 pages) meeting ≥3 of 4 rubric criteria."
