  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can explain core calculus concepts (limits, continuity, rates of change) by manipulating 3D graphs in a VR environment.",
    "In teams of four, learners will document the problem-solving process for 3 math problems using multimodal representations (2 visual models, 1 audio explanation, 3+ text annotations), achieving an \"Excellent\" grade in at least 4 out of 5 peer evaluation rubric items.",
    "Learners will analyze fluid dynamics data (3+ variables: velocity, pressure, temperature) collected from VR simulations, establish a mathematical model based on differential equations, and create a 10-minute presentation achieving an 80%+ success rate in peer and instructor evaluations."
