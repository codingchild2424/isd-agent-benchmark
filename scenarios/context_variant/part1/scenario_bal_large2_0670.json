    "Learners apply at least three language strategies to build trust relationships (relational social capital) in VR-based collaborative tools",
    "Over three weeks, learners integrate three types of team knowledge (e.g., jargon, cultural context, communication strategies) into project deliverables, (1) develop two new language expressions (exploratory learning) for team sharing, and (2) achieve applied learning outcomes by applying three existing language systems (e.g., grammar rules, vocabulary expansion, pronunciation principles) meeting ≥4 of 5 rubric criteria (creativity, accuracy, practicality, collaboration, completeness)."
