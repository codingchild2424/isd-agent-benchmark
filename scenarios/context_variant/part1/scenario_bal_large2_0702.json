    "Identify three or more ethical dilemmas that can occur in social media environments",
    "Apply an ethical decision-making process when using social media in the role of a social worker through VR simulation",
    "Design social media utilization guidelines from an international perspective through asynchronous collaboration",
    "Graduate students complete a 5-page report and 10-minute presentation within four weeks for each of three ethical dilemma cases (data bias, algorithmic fairness, personal information protection) presented in a project-based assessment. They apply a five-step problem-solving framework (problem definition → cause analysis → alternative generation → implementation plan → evaluation metrics) and achieve an ‘excellent’ grade in four or more of five rubric items, including clear justification for each step, feasibility assessment of alternatives, and measurability of evaluation metrics."
