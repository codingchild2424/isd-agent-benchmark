  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Elementary science education fundamentals and basic experimental observation techniques, foundational understanding of variable identification and scientific inquiry processes",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A program for pre-service teachers to cultivate science pedagogy skills and support adaptation to organizational life, emphasizing the scientific inquiry process (hypothesis formulation, experimental design, data analysis, conclusion drawing). The program intensively trains core competencies—such as experimental design, evidence collection, and result interpretation—to enable systematic application of scientific inquiry methods in real educational settings.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners improve their self-efficacy in designing science experiments, controlling variables, and lesson planning by over 20% through collaborative activities with peer teachers, and strengthen their ability to formulate hypotheses and derive evidence-based conclusions.",
    "Learners achieve weekly scientific inquiry objectives (observation, measurement, analysis) with over 80% accuracy using digital resources (video lectures, quizzes, collaboration tools) in the LMS and confirm a 20% improvement in their scientific problem-solving confidence index via self-assessment surveys at the course’s conclusion.",
    "Learners develop and implement plans for applying science education theories and experiment-based lessons through intentional reading activities, advancing their critical thinking and data interpretation skills during the inquiry process."
