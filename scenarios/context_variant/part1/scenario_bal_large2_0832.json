    "Learners analyze three real-world cases from high-risk industrial sites (construction, chemical, etc.) and develop a 5-step or fewer action plan (including risk assessment, response protocols, and training strategies) to improve safety decision-making processes, meeting at least four of five evaluation criteria.",
    "Learners collaborate with peer experts to design and implement field-centered problem-solving strategies",
    "Within three weeks, learners identify three technology stacks (e.g., Java, Spring Boot, AWS) related to public IT projects (e.g., e-government framework development) and submit a personalized learning roadmap to the instructor, including weekly learning goals (2 hours theory/3 hours practice) and assessment methods (80%+ on 10-question quizzes, 3-step checklist for practical assignments)."
