  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic mathematics education concepts (equations, functions, statistics), online learning experience, foundational problem-solving strategies, and basic graph interpretation/probability calculation skills",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "This course involves project-based assessments in a smartphone-based learning environment (utilizing calculator apps and graphing tools) with the goal of developing mathematical subject-matter expertise (conceptual understanding, problem-solving skills, assessment design capabilities). Special emphasis is placed on statistical data analysis and probability visualization tools to enhance learners' data interpretation skills.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can compare and explain the core features of Lesson Study and Learning Study models and differentiate equation-solving and graph-interpretation strategies through variable analysis of mathematical concepts.",
    "Learners can apply the four stages of Understanding by Design (UbD) (diagnosis, design, implementation, evaluation) over six months to achieve ≥80% accuracy in equation-solving for 10 math concepts and submit lesson designs meeting ≥4/5 (5-point scale) in learner feedback surveys.",
    "Learners can collaborate with two peer teachers to develop three math lesson improvement strategies (e.g., enhanced graph interpretation activities, probability visualization, statistical tool integration) within four weeks and submit project outputs scoring ≥40/50 (80%) on the institutional rubric (plan: 15 points, execution report: 20 points, reflection journal: 15 points).",
    "Learners can design three teacher professional development activities within six months under limited technical conditions (unstable internet, basic digital tools): (1) online collaboration: co-creating ≥5 math problems via LaTeX, (2) offline workshops: crafting/demonstrating three manipulatives (fraction bars, geoboards, algebra tiles), (3) hybrid feedback: sharing biweekly 5-minute problem-solving videos. Each activity must be validated by ≥80% participant completion and practical outputs."
