    "Learners enhance their ability to collaborate with peers and share knowledge to solve complex mathematical problems.",
    "Within six months, learners establish three knowledge management strategies (e.g., collaboration tools, knowledge-sharing frameworks, feedback systems) based on organizational learning environment analysis in project-based assessments (team research tasks) and achieve over 80% attainment in peer and instructor evaluations.",
    "Graduate students apply social constructivist principles (collaborative knowledge building, contextual learning) on online discussion boards, providing feedback (150+ characters) with three specific rationales (conceptual accuracy, logical consistency, real-world applicability) on peers’ mathematical ideas at least twice weekly. Over four weeks, they maintain weekly reflective journals (500–700 characters) documenting their thinking processes, with over 80% of their feedback achieving “average or above” ratings on peer evaluation rubrics."
