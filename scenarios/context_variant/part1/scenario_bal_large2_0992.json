  "title": "Workshop on Developing Expertise in Mathematical Modeling and Optimization for Large-Scale Sports Coaching Policy Development",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational education policy knowledge, basic sports coaching principles, leadership theories, introductory statistics and data analysis concepts, understanding of linear equations, ability to interpret probability distributions",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Simulation/VR-based",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learners (teachers/in-service teachers) experience the process of developing sports coaching policies using VR simulations in limited technological environments (primarily smartphones) and propose practical implementation plans through project-based assessments. Special emphasis is placed on policy analysis using mathematical tools such as data measurement, graph interpretation, and probabilistic forecasting. Learners verify the effectiveness of policy models through computational and analytical processes based on real-world data.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners analyze cultural change data in sports organizations using mathematical models and enhance their ability to develop policy strategies through equations and optimization techniques",
    "Learners analyze interaction data collected from VR simulations using probability distributions and graphs to predict coaching policy implementation scenarios and make statistically significant decisions",
    "In 3–4 person team projects, learners design one physical education policy model using linear programming (Excel Solver or Python PuLP) and evaluate an optimization model achieving ≥80% goal attainment under budget constraints. They also earn ≥12/15 points on peer evaluation and instructor feedback rubrics (validity, feasibility, effectiveness)"
