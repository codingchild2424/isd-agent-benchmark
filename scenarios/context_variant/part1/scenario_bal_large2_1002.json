  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic computer literacy and logical thinking skills, foundational understanding of digital environments, interest in solving social issues, and basic awareness of civic rights and community engagement",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",

    "Learners select and complete one of three real-life projects (automated household budget calculation, schedule management system, community data analysis) using basic programming syntax (conditionals, loops, functions), submit results within a week that receive an average of 4/5 or higher in peer evaluations and 8/10 or higher in instructor feedback, thereby cultivating problem-solving skills applying concepts of civic rights and digital citizenship",
    "Mastering core concepts at their own pace through module-based mastery assessments (80% or higher), cultivating the ability to solve social problems using digital tools, and strengthening data-driven decision-making capabilities for community development",
