  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners must perform real-time musical collaboration with ensemble members using mobile synchronization techniques and develop mathematical modeling skills for rhythm pattern analysis.",
    "Learners must achieve ≥80% accuracy in musical expression via digital gesture-based communication, convert gesture data into probability distributions, and perform statistical analysis.",
    "Within one week, learners must build one ensemble model (regression/clustering) for data analysis, submit a 3-minute explanatory video, and evaluate three peers’ videos using a structured feedback form (model accuracy, visualization, practicality)."
