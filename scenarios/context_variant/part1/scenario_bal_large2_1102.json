  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners collect local community environmental issue data using mobile devices and systematically analyze linguistic materials through text analysis and keyword extraction.",
    "Learners can create a concept map of socio-environmental issues based on field survey results and systematically organize related professional vocabulary and situational expressions.",
    "Learners select one community issue (e.g., language barriers in multicultural families, lack of awareness of local history) and develop a language education content prototype (3 activity modules) integrating writing, reading, and expressive activities. They receive a feasibility evaluation of an average of 4 points or higher on a 5-point scale from an expert review panel."
