  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational science knowledge (experimental design, data measurement, variable analysis) and experience using online learning platforms. Particularly requires understanding of scientific methodologies (hypothesis testing, observational recording, experimental error analysis)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A collaboration-centered learning environment for strengthening science-related job competencies: emphasizes inquiry processes (observation-hypothesis-experiment-analysis-conclusion) for solving real scientific problems. Learners systematically experience scientific thinking processes such as variable control, data interpretation, and evidence-based conclusion drawing.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners enhance scientific inquiry (systematic observation, hypothesis formulation, control of independent/dependent variables, experimental design, and execution) and problem-solving skills through group collaboration under three-tier (high/medium/low) instructor scaffolding support",
    "Learners experience the stepwise characteristics of collaborative knowledge building via LMS discussion boards: sharing individual perspectives → question-based scientific analysis (data comparison and pattern identification) → collective in-depth inquiry (evidence collection and conclusion drawing)",
    "In summative assessments, learners derive three or more creative solutions to complex science problems (based on real-world phenomena) per group and explain them using scientific evidence (experimental data/quantitative analysis results)"
