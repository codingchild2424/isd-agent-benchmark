  "title": "[Large-Scale] Blended Learning-Based Creative Problem-Solving (CPS) Course Design: Language Subject Integration Approach (Strengthening Text Analysis and Creative Expression)",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic problem-solving skills, digital device proficiency, understanding of core language subject concepts (grammar, text types, vocabulary). Additionally, experience analyzing text structures across genres (expository, argumentative, narrative) and possession of fundamental writing techniques",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course emphasizing real-life problem-solving (e.g., effective report writing, debate topic development) through CPS training linked to language skills (reading, writing, speaking). Aims to enhance learners’ linguistic analysis (text structure identification, contextual vocabulary understanding) and creative expression (genre-based writing, persuasive presentations). Stresses collaborative language production in hybrid digital-paper environments.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can systematically identify and define causes of language-related problems (e.g., text structure analysis, vocabulary errors, communication barriers) using the 6-stage CPS (Creative Problem Solving) model. They can apply problem-solving strategies tailored to various text types, such as narratives, expository texts, and argumentative essays.",
    "Learners can apply creative thinking skills (idea generation/convergence) in a blended learning environment combining digital tools (pads/tablets) and paper-based activities (writing notebooks, concept map creation). They can enhance language expression by exchanging real-time feedback with peers using digital collaboration tools.",
    "Learners can revise a draft essay or presentation materials based on at least three peer feedbacks and demonstrate critical thinking and language expression skills by achieving at least 80% compliance in two out of three rubric criteria (clarity, logic, creativity). The feedback process includes grammar correction and vocabulary appropriateness evaluation."
