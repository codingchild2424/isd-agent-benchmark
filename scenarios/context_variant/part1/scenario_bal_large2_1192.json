  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Secondary mathematics education experience (algebra, geometry, statistics), basic online platform usage skills, foundational problem-solving/proof skills in mathematics, function/equation interpretation ability",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A practitioner-centered creativity development program combining asynchronous/synchronous activities optimized for smartphone-based learning environments. Focus is placed on applying mathematical concepts (functions, equations, data analysis) to real-world problem-solving. Includes real-life connected activities like measurement data analysis, graph interpretation, and statistical reasoning.",

    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Propose three or more reconstruction strategies for math education content (equations, graphs, statistics) based on the C5 model, emphasizing the ability to clearly express mathematical proofs and calculation processes",
    "Based on connectivism principles, design learner-engaged digital environments (e.g., Zoom Polling, Padlet) and integrate activities that visualize mathematical problem-solving processes (e.g., graphs, function modeling).",
    "Learners can develop two creativity-enhancing math-based (probability, geometry, calculus, etc.) instructional activities suitable for solving vocational training field problems using the 3-stage AAA Model (Analyze-Assemble-Application) and achieve over 80 points on an expert evaluation rubric (25% creativity, 25% practicality, 25% math application, 25% AAA Model fidelity), systematically applying formulas and equations in problem-solving.",
    "Conduct peer feedback using a rubric aligned with Thai Teacher Professional Standards and evaluate the clarity of mathematical thinking processes (e.g., hypothesis setting, variable control, logical reasoning)."
