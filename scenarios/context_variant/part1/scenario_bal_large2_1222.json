  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can explain methods for integrating gamification elements (points, levels, rewards) into early childhood cognitive activity design with at least three real-world examples and submit team design deliverables meeting four or more of five peer evaluation rubric items.",
    "Learners can implement a system that adjusts the difficulty of science education content (e.g., physics problem sets) in real-time using Python-based adaptive learning algorithms over a 2–4 week mid-term course, and develop a prototype capable of changing difficulty levels by at least three stages based on learner responses (downward adjustment if accuracy is below 70%, upward adjustment if above 90%).",
    "Within a 4-week project-based assessment period, learners can design one digital learning module reflecting real-world requirements of early childhood education institutions (e.g., science inquiry activities for ages 3–5), complete functional testing (user interface evaluation, content validity verification), and submit a prototype.",
    "To analyze the interactive effects of a prototype running on tablet devices, learners can collect three quantitative metrics (e.g., usage time, error frequency) and two qualitative metrics (e.g., user feedback, observational records), and write an analytical report of approximately 500 characters based on the findings."
