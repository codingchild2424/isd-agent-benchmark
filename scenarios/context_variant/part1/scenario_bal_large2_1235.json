  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic experience with e-learning platforms and understanding of secondary education curricula, foundational language education methodologies (grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation instruction strategies), and digital literacy (proficiency in online learning tools)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Simulation/VR-based",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A practice-oriented course for secondary school teachers to explore the practicality of e-learning tools in language education. Develops strategies focused on improving learners' reading comprehension (text analysis), expressive skills (writing/presentation), and communication abilities (dialogue simulations). Cultivates practical language use through cultural context integration",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Using survey tools, identify at least three perceived e-learning usability factors: language learning effectiveness (vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation), interactivity (real-time feedback), and personalized feedback (individualized learning paths).",
    "Interpret structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis results to explain the influence of learning environment (digital literacy), lecture delivery methods (multimedia utilization), tutor characteristics (customized coaching), and support conditions (technical infrastructure) on language acquisition (communication skills).",
    "Propose five or more criteria for evaluating the practical value of e-learning tools in simulation/VR-based educational environments: vocabulary scalability (context-based learning), grammar practice efficiency (automated scoring systems), pronunciation accuracy (voice recognition technology), contextual understanding support (situational dialogue simulations), and cultural context reflection (multicultural content)."
