  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Elementary language proficiency (basic listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills), basic digital literacy and comprehension of grammatical structures (parts of speech, sentence components), and experience analyzing diverse text types (explanatory, argumentative, conversational texts)",

    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Focuses on cultivating practical language abilities through learner interaction, conducting problem-based collaborative activities in online/offline environments. Particularly aims to develop comprehensive language skills through expression considering cultural contexts (high-context/low-context culture comparison), analysis of various text types (expository, argumentative, conversational texts), and appropriate vocabulary usage by context (formal/informal settings). Additionally applies rubrics evaluating learners' reading comprehension (text structure identification) and expressive skills (creative language use)",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can analyze real-world language use cases to design and apply context-appropriate communication strategies considering discourse context and pragmatic elements (cooperation, speech acts, social relationships).",
    "Learners collaborate with 4–5 peers to complete complex language tasks (1 presentation, 2 negotiation dialogues) and achieve an average of 3.5 or higher on a 5-point scale rubric for each task. Comprehensive language skills are evaluated, including vocabulary selection (context-appropriate usage), grammatical accuracy (use of complex sentence structures), pronunciation clarity (intonation and stress), and nonverbal expression (gestures and facial expressions).",
    "Learners systematically build three or more language learning portfolios (writing, presentation, project) using digital tools (Notion, Padlet, etc.). They propose improvements reflecting at least three of five feedback items received from two peers and an instructor, and compare the difference between self-assessment and peer assessment scores within 10%. Evaluations include text type analysis (expository, argumentative, conversational) and cultural context reflection."
