  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can explain the five basic design principles (balance, emphasis, contrast, rhythm, and unity) through AR content with over 80% accuracy.",
    "Learners can execute the process of applying principles to real-world design problems using AR simulation tools at least three times.",
    "Formative assessments (quizzes, peer feedback) improve understanding of design theory by over 30% compared to pre-assessments."
