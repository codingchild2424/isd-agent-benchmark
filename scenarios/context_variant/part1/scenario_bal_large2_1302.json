  "title": "[Large-Scale] Performance-Centered Language Education Using Ancient Greek Drama Text Analysis and Expert Mantle Techniques",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic theater theory and foundational knowledge of ancient Greek culture, basic grammar and text analysis skills, fundamental reading comprehension and writing abilities, group activity experience.",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Creating a practical learning environment through the use of digital devices and group collaboration, focusing on improving learners' reading comprehension, expressive skills (oral and written), and collaborative communication (providing and receiving feedback). It particularly deepens language proficiency through the modern application and creative reinterpretation of classical texts.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners analyze the historical, cultural, and linguistic features (dialogue structure, rhetoric, vocabulary usage, stylistic analysis) of ancient Greek drama from a modern perspective, reinterpret texts, and explain intertextuality between texts based on reading comprehension and critical thinking.",
    "Learners perform at least three roles (e.g., characters or production team members) using the expert cloak technique (Role-Immersion Method), submit a portfolio documenting creative problem-solving processes (problem definition, solution strategies, result evaluation), and achieve an \"excellent\" rating in at least four out of five rubric items. Role performance must reflect characters' expressive methods (speaking, writing), linguistic features (vocabulary selection, sentence structure), and cultural contexts.",
    "Using digital tools (Canva, Padlet, etc.) and offline workshops, learners collaborate with 3–5 team members to plan and execute a 10-minute drama performance project within six months, achieve at least 80% attainment across peer and instructor evaluation criteria (creativity, collaboration, completeness, linguistic accuracy, expressiveness), with particular emphasis on dialogue delivery accuracy, pronunciation clarity, and nonverbal expression (gestures, facial expressions)."
