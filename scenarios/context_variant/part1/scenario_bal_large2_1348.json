  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic public health knowledge and emergency response experience, foundational language education design skills (grammar-vocabulary application, reading comprehension strategies, and writing structuring techniques)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Strengthens disaster preparedness simulation design competencies for pre- and in-service language teachers. Focuses on text analysis in emergencies, context-specific expression generation, and collaborative problem-solving skills.",
    "institution_type": "Graduate school",
    "learner_age": "40s and above",
    "learner_education": "Adult learner (non-degree)",
    "learner_role": "Pre-service/In-service teacher",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners achieve an 80%+ goal completion rate within 60 minutes in a bioterrorism scenario-based escape game by employing teamwork and problem-solving strategies, applying situational communication strategies (e.g., emergency reports, role-specific dialogues).",
    "Explain the design principles of escape games combining digital tools and physical puzzles, and create templates applicable to language education contexts (e.g., integrated reading/writing/listening tasks).",
    "Learners meet team collaboration efficiency metrics (e.g., participation ≥85%, idea contributions) through formative assessments and propose improvement plans based on linguistic feedback (e.g., peer evaluation rubrics, self-reflection journals)."
