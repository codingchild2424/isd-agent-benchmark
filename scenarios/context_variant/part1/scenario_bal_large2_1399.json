  "title": "[Large-Scale] Language Communication-Based Simulation Training for Inter-Agency Collaboration in Domestic Violence Response",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic knowledge of domestic violence prevention and response, understanding of related institutional workflows, fundamental communication skills (listening/speaking/reading/writing), and specialized terminology comprehension. Particularly, experience with empathetic questioning techniques and clear terminology usage",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Simulation/VR-based",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Practical learning competency enhancement program where professionals experience victim-centered interagency collaboration cases. Focuses on language expression skills for domestic violence victim interactions (empathic questioning, emotion reflection, nonviolent communication) and interagency documentation (clear terminology, protocol standardization, technical term explanations). Includes VR role-play training for expressive and reading skill development.",
    "institution_type": "Vocational training institution",
    "learner_age": "In their 30s",
    "learner_education": "High school",
    "learner_role": "Office worker (administrative/management)",
    "domain_expertise": "Beginner"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Build interagency collaboration systems (≥3 agencies) centered on victim case simulations, design clear communication protocols between agencies, and strengthen document writing skills incorporating technical term explanations and empathetic language",
    "Apply effective communication strategies (e.g., empathetic listening, nonviolent expression, emotional reflection) in VR role-plays for interagency conflict scenarios and select situationally appropriate linguistic expressions (empathetic questions, clear terminology)",
    "Through project-based assessment within one week, analyze one regional business collaboration case, produce a draft interagency collaboration manual (5 pages), and achieve 'excellent' ratings in ≥2 out of 3 evaluation criteria (clarity, practicality, completeness). The manual must include victim-centered empathetic language (emotional reflection expressions, nonviolent expressions) and technical term explanations"
