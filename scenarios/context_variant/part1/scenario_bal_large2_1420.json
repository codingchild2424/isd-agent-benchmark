  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic biology knowledge, teaching experience, and scientific text analysis/writing skills (understanding academic terminology, logical writing, presentation techniques)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "An activity-based blended learning program for pre-service/in-service teachers to strengthen cell biology education competencies. Integrates scientific inquiry processes with language expression (academic writing/presentation/discussion) to simultaneously improve conceptual understanding, critical thinking, and communication skills. Particularly emphasizes accuracy in specialized terminology and clarity in explaining experimental results.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners systematically explain core concepts of cell structure and function through the scientific inquiry process (hypothesis formulation→experimental analysis→conclusion drawing) and linguistic expression (academic text/oral explanation).",
    "Learners design activity-based instructional methods in blended learning environments and integrate language learning strategies (vocabulary expansion, grammar structure utilization, contextual expression training) to improve learners' reading comprehension and expressive skills.",
    "Educators design teaching strategies for each stage of hypothesis formulation (problem definition and variable control), experimental analysis (data visualization and pattern identification), and conclusion drawing (causal reasoning and generalization) within one week and submit a lesson design plan receiving at least 4 points (on a 5-point scale) in \"clarity\" and \"practicality\" from two out of three peer reviewers. The ability to clearly convey experimental processes and results through linguistic and visual materials (tables, graphs, academic reports) is evaluated."
