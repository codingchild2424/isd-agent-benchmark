  "title": "Large-Scale Clinical Judgment Enhancement Nursing Education Course via Virtual Learning: Analyzing Medical Language Policies and Strengthening Professional Communication Competencies",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic nursing theory and practical experience, understanding of essential medical grammar (sentence structure, tense) and terminology (diagnosis, treatment, symptoms), and patient record documentation experience (adherence to medical documentation formats)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Blended learning environment utilizing medical simulation software and virtual patient cases. Flexible scheduling for working professionals. Strengthens training in analyzing medical language policies and writing professional medical documents (patient records, reports). Includes training in communication strategies considering cultural contexts.",
    "institution_type": "Graduate school",
    "learner_age": "In their 30s",
    "learner_education": "University",
    "learner_role": "Pre-service/In-service teacher",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Through virtual patient scenarios, over 85% of learners can apply clinical judgment criteria and utilize core professional vocabulary (e.g., symptoms, diagnosis, treatment plan) and culturally contextualized communication strategies in nurse-patient interactions.",
    "In a blended learning environment, learners achieve a grade of B or higher when their nursing intervention simulation performance is measured on a 3-level rubric and demonstrate accurate grammatical structures (subject-verb agreement, tense consistency) and professional terminology (e.g., symptoms, procedures, protocols) in patient records and reports.",
    "Graduate learners select one of three real-world medical language policy cases (e.g., multicultural patient communication guidelines, AI translation tool regulations, hospital official language designation) provided during a 3-week project-based assessment. They write a 1,500-character case report including critical thinking (validity/limitations analysis) and decision-making rationale (comparing at least three policy criteria). The report must include at least five professional terms (e.g., diagnosis, treatment, protocol, symptoms, medical ethics), follow an introduction-body-conclusion structure, and cite clear data (statistics, research findings). It must also achieve an \"Excellent\" (4/5 points) grade or higher in at least four of five rubric items (criticality, evidence fidelity, structure, expression, professionalism) during peer and instructor evaluations."
