    "Learners can operate a real-time language feedback system on smartphone-based collaboration tools (e.g., KakaoTalk) by: 1) creating three feedback request templates (for writing, presentations, reading), 2) delivering daily language feedback to five team members for two weeks, and 3) achieving an 80% feedback response rate and deriving at least ten language improvement points",
    "Conducting at least five knowledge-sharing sessions among teachers to improve language learning achievement for students with disabilities (e.g., grammar instruction strategies, customized reading material development, expression enhancement techniques)"
