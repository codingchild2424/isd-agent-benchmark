  "title": "Large-Scale Social-Ecological Grassland Science Education Reform: Simulation/VR Learning Design Based on the BOPPPS Model",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational knowledge in agricultural science, practical farming experience, and understanding of sustainable agricultural systems. Additionally requires basic awareness of local socio-political, economic, and cultural contexts, as well as comprehension of ecosystem service concepts",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Simulation/VR-based",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Establishing a digital education environment to strengthen theory-practice integration. Emphasizes grassland management competency from a socio-ecological systems perspective, aiming for instructional design that considers climate change and regional economic development interactions. Structured to allow learners to experience citizen science approaches through collaboration.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will design scenarios linking introductory agricultural science theory to sustainable agricultural systems using the 6-step BOPPPS model (Preparation-Objectives-Preparatory Activities-Presentation-Practice-Summary), proposing innovative approaches that reflect local economic and geographic conditions.",
    "Through virtual experiments on feed processing and storage in simulation/VR environments, learners will analyze resource circulation issues within agricultural ecosystems and improve comprehensive resource management capabilities—considering political and economic variables—by at least 80%.",
    "Within four weeks, learners will work in teams to develop a feed management system prototype reflecting local community economic structures (e.g., agricultural product distribution networks, small business support policies) and submit it with a score of 70 or higher on an evaluation rubric (Functionality 30%, Innovation 30%, Local Relevance 40%), applying citizen-participatory problem-solving strategies."
