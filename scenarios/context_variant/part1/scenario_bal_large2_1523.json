  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic language learning experience (grammar-vocabulary comprehension, text reading-writing), digital device proficiency, and adaptability to asynchronous collaborative environments",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Language education course in smartphone-centric limited-technology environments. Asynchronous text-based activities (integrated reading/writing tasks, peer reviews) and discussions occur via LMS, with summative assessment emphasizing expressive/receptive skills and grammatical accuracy. Includes contextual approaches for intercultural communication competence.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can explain how to design text structure analysis and vocabulary expansion activities based on language acquisition theories (e.g., input hypothesis, output hypothesis).",
    "Based on feedback from three peers, learners can evaluate their own learning design in terms of grammatical structures (subject-verb agreement, tense consistency) and expressive skills (vocabulary diversity, sentence connectivity, discourse coherence), and submit a revised version incorporating at least two improvement strategies.",
    "Learners implement a collaborative approach to share integrated reading-writing learning design cases and intercultural communication strategies (considering cultural context and nonverbal expressions) via an LMS."
