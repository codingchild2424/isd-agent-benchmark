  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Elementary science education concepts, basic instructional design principles, foundational understanding of the scientific inquiry process (observation-hypothesis-experiment-conclusion), basic variable control and experimental design, and comprehension of scientific argumentation (claim-evidence-reasoning) structure",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A science education course applying activity theory optimized for smartphone-based learning environments. Focuses on experimental data measurement/analysis, scientific argumentation (claim-evidence-reasoning), and evidence-based conclusions. Particularly emphasizes control of variables (controlled/manipulated variables) in experimental design and data visualization (graphs/charts).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners apply the core components of activity theory (subject, tools, community, etc.) to the scientific inquiry process (hypothesis setting–experiment design–variable control–data analysis–conclusion drawing).",
    "Learners establish and implement science education activity plans integrating instructional design theory and activity theory, clearly distinguishing independent/dependent variables in the experiment design phase and deriving evidence-based conclusions.",
    "Graduate students, in collaborative teams of up to four members, develop science learning materials consisting of at least three experimental modules (measurement–analysis–visualization) using smartphone-based tools (Google Science Journal, Lab4Physics, etc.) and achieve a suitability score of at least 80% in peer reviews and expert evaluations. The materials must include elements of scientific argumentation (claim-evidence-reasoning) and data analysis (graphs/statistics)."
