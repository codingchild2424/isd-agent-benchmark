  "title": "[Large-scale] Smart Buffalo Farm Management System Design and Scientific Data Utilization: Evidence-Based Decision-Making Through Experimentation, Observation, and Analysis",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic agricultural management knowledge, fundamental smartphone app usage, understanding of scientific measurement (temperature/weight) and data recording methods, and foundational concepts in experimental design and variable control",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learners aim to develop advanced expertise in small-scale buffalo farm management, focusing on field problem-solving skills that integrate smart technologies and scientific inquiry methods. They engage in hands-on projects in a BYOD environment, with an emphasis on system optimization through observation and hypothesis validation. Core elements include data-driven decision-making and farm operational efficiency through scientific methodologies (experimentation, analysis, and conclusion-drawing).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Applying the ADDIE model to systematically execute an agricultural management app design process step-by-step, including hypothesis setting and experimental design for scientific variables (weight/body temperature/estrus cycle).",
    "Learners select three core functions for a digital system managing buffalo farm records (individual breeding history database), health monitoring (weight/body temperature tracking and anomaly detection), and breeding management (estrus prediction algorithm development). They create prototype designs for each function, considering measurement accuracy and analysis processes.",
    "Learners apply user-centered design principles (accessibility, intuitiveness, efficiency) to create an app interface prototype in Figma or Adobe XD that reflects farmers' needs (crop management, task scheduling, cost analysis). They achieve 80+ points on a peer evaluation rubric (functionality 30%, usability 30%, design 20%, innovation 20%). The prototype incorporates scientific analysis via data visualization (graphs/charts) and performs evidence-based design improvements.",
    "Within a 4-week intermediate course, learners analyze three farm management scenarios (crop yield prediction modeling, irrigation system monitoring sensor data analysis, etc.) and develop a mobile app prototype meeting four or more of the five project-based evaluation rubric items (functionality, usability, practicality). The process includes evidence collection and conclusion drawing based on experimental data, applying scientific inquiry methods."
