  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can identify five types of ethical dilemmas (personal information leakage, fake news dissemination, cyberbullying, digital divide, AI bias) that may occur on social media from a citizenship perspective and analyze them in terms of social impact and rights protection.",
    "Within one week, learners will apply a five-step ethical decision-making framework (problem definition → stakeholder analysis → alternative evaluation → decision → evaluation) to three real-world scenario cases (workplace conflict, environmental issues, AI ethics dilemmas), write a one-page analysis report, and achieve an average score of 4 or higher on a 5-point peer evaluation scale. The report must include strategies for respecting cultural diversity and complying with legal requirements.",
    "Learners will propose three or more legal/ethical requirements (digital rights protection, cultural diversity respect, data transparency, citizen participation assurance) to consider when establishing a social media policy within an organization and suggest citizen engagement plans, including community linkage strategies."
