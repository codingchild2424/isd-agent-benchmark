    "Design a learner-customized feedback system utilizing an adaptive learning platform",
    "Within one week, learners develop one social studies project-based learning scenario using one of the virtual/augmented reality tools (Unity, Zepeto, etc.) and secure feasibility scores of 4.0+ (5-point scale) on average via peer review and instructor feedback.",
    "Within one week, learners construct a learner agency assessment rubric with five criteria (goal setting, resource utilization, self-reflection, collaboration skills, time management), define three-tier scales (basic-developing-proficient) for each, and produce a rubric meeting 80%+ suitability (4.0+ average on a 5-point scale) through peer review.",
    "Using digital collaboration tools like Google Workspace or Microsoft Teams, learners establish strategies for managing large groups (>50 learners) within one week (including task distribution, progress monitoring, feedback systems) and obtain approval of 80%+ feasibility from two out of three peer reviewers."
