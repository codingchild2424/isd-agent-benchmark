  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic engineering concepts, understanding of water treatment processes, and foundational awareness of social responsibility (citizen rights, institutions, culture, relationships), with experience in analyzing community issues",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "For technical undergraduate professionals, this program implements blended physical/virtual lab learning via mobile-based microlearning in BYOD environments. Measures learning outcomes through project-based assessments: exploring civic engagement strategies and institutional improvements for sustainable community water management systems.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Compare and explain the complementary characteristics of physical and virtual laboratories within socio-technical contexts (citizen rights, institutions, culture).",
    "Within one week, learners will conduct jar testing in a hybrid mode to perform 3 key stages of water treatment (chemical dosing, coagulation, sedimentation). Based on experimental results, they will produce a report meeting ≥4 of 5 social responsibility criteria (environmental impact, fairness, transparency, economic viability, citizen participation).",
    "Learners will collect and analyze experimental data (20 surveys, 10 observational records) related to community issues (e.g., traffic congestion, waste management). They will write a 5-page project report and propose 3 solutions (policy recommendations, technology applications, citizen collaboration) in a 10-minute presentation."
