    "Learners can analyze material design problems reflecting high-temperature gas turbine manufacturing conditions (up to 1,200°C, 500-hour durability), propose three or more material candidates (nickel-based superalloys, ceramic composites, silicon carbide) using ANSYS Workbench or Abaqus FEA tools, and submit a design plan within three weeks that meets four or more of the five technical feasibility checklist items (thermal expansion coefficient, creep resistance, oxidation stability, fatigue strength, thermal conductivity).",
