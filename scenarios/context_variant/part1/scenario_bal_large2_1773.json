  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Knowledge of basic teaching-learning theories and online learning platform usage, foundational understanding of social learning theories (collaborative learning, cultural context comprehension, citizenship education)",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learners are university students or job seekers aiming to strengthen practical competencies in online education design and implementation. Project-based assessments evaluate their ability to apply skills in real educational contexts (multicultural education, digital citizenship, social interaction enhancement). Particular emphasis is placed on responding to changes in social systems (political, economic, cultural factors) and education policies.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can apply core principles of online instructional design (interaction design, content structuring, assessment methods) to a social learning context (collaborative environments, cultural diversity, citizenship development) to develop a five-week microlearning module.",
    "Using digital tools (QuizMaker, video editors, LMS), learners can create activity materials improving learner engagement by ≥20%, integrating citizenship elements for multicultural education and social relationship enhancement.",
    "Over 1–6 months, learners can present ≥2 cases of improving existing lecture materials through ≥3 feedback collections (surveys, focus group interviews) and propose 3 practical strategies to address educational system changes (digital transformation, flexible assessment, social equity)."
