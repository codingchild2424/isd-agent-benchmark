  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational engineering theories and discipline-specific expertise (electrical/chemical/mechanical/civil) + basic grammar for technical writing (sentence structure, tense agreement) + understanding of specialized terminology (core vocabulary by engineering field) + logical expression skills for presentations",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Blended learning course where engineering learners collaborate on projects in limited-technology environments (smartphone-centric). Evaluates technical report writing (grammar, jargon, structure), presentation skills (logical flow, visual effects), and jargon usage (accuracy, appropriateness). Develops comprehensive communication competencies through peer assessment and feedback integration",

  "learning_goals": [
    "In multidisciplinary teams (4-5 members), learners develop design solutions reflecting technical, economic, social, and environmental constraints. They achieve ≥ 70/100 points in evaluation criteria (creativity 25%, feasibility 30%, social impact 25%, economic viability 20%) through a 10-minute presentation (structured logic, specialized terminology) and 5-minute Q&A (professional communication strategies).",
    "Learners apply agile/scrum frameworks in blended learning environments, collaborate with 3-5 teammates, achieve ≥ 80% task completion using Jira or Trello, and submit within deadlines: a 10+ page technical report (specialized terminology, accurate grammar, logical structure) and 15+ slide presentation (visual expression, clear text).",
    "Learners document decision-making processes in 3 stages (design/implementation/verification) via reflective practice in 1 engineering design project. They produce technical documents and presentation materials meeting ≥ 4 of 5 peer rubric items (grammar accuracy, terminology appropriateness, logical consistency, visual effectiveness, social impact), incorporate ≥ 3 feedback items, and submit a final report."
