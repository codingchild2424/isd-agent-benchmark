  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners design a simple data encryption project using AES-256 or RSA algorithms aligned with information security principles (confidentiality, integrity, availability). They implement it with 90%+ success across 5+ test cases, fostering digital citizenship and analyzing technology’s impact on social relations and institutions.",
    "Within 3 weeks, learners simulate 3+ core stages of smart manufacturing processes (automated assembly lines) using AR/VR tools (e.g., Unity 3D, Unreal Engine). They submit prototypes meeting 4+ of 5 institutional evaluation criteria, analyzing Industry 4.0’s impact on industrial structures, employment, and regional economies.",
    "Learners develop mobile spreadsheet tool skills for biotech data analysis and evaluate the socio-economic/ethical impacts of biotech advancements. They assess genetic editing’s effects on healthcare systems and patient rights from a cultural perspective."
