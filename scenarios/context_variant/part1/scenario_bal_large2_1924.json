Science concepts should be explained through daily-life examples (e.g., gravity - measuring swing periods at playgrounds, photosynthesis - designing plant cultivation experiments) to enhance understanding. All activities must reflect the scientific inquiry process (hypothesis setting → variable-controlled experiment design → quantitative data analysis → evidence-based conclusions). Particularly emphasizes the use of measurement tools (thermometers, scales) and data recording (tables, graphs).",

    "Learners can select three science concepts (e.g., measuring photosynthesis efficiency, calculating gravitational acceleration, analyzing electrical circuit resistance) during a mid-term course (3 weeks), visually and auditorily represent them using multimedia materials (videos/infographics), and achieve an average score of 4 or higher on a 5-point scale from peer evaluations and instructor feedback. (Measurable evidence: mandatory variable control records, data visualization materials)",
    "Learners can revise at least three core elements of educational scenarios (inquiry objectives, experimental activities, evidence-based assessments) over two weeks based on provided feedback (peer evaluations, instructor comments), and submit revised scenarios applying four or more items from a self-directed learning strategy checklist (goal resetting, experimental tool utilization, reflective journaling, etc.).
