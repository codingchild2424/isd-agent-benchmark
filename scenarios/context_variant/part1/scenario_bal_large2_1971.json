    "Learners can apply three or more foundational art techniques (sketching, color theory, digital drawing) to the scientific inquiry process (hypothesis formulation–experimentation–analysis–conclusion) using digital tools, with a focus on deriving measurable outcomes through variable control.",
    "Learners can submit a lesson design plan that integrates the three core elements of the TPACK framework (technology, pedagogy, content), applies three or more variable control strategies (e.g., standardizing experimental conditions, maintaining tool consistency), and achieves over 80% peer evaluation scores by referencing evidence-based approaches (two or more research papers/case studies).",
    "Learners can complete mobile-friendly art education projects (portfolio creation, virtual exhibition planning) and produce learning outcomes combining quantitative metrics (engagement, completeness) and qualitative analysis (creativity, expressiveness)."
