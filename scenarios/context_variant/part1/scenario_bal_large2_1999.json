  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic ICT proficiency, secondary mathematics teaching experience, understanding of core mathematical concepts (functions, geometry, statistics, etc.), logical reasoning skills for mathematical problem-solving",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",

    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Pre- and in-service teachers learn to develop, manage, and repurpose/recontextualize math educational materials using web-based tools. Project-based assessments in BYOD environments strengthen mathematical problem-solving and digital resource creation. Emphasizes real-world math modeling with a focus on statistical reasoning through data analysis and graph interpretation.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can develop at least three learning objects incorporating mathematical concepts (equations, graphs, statistics) using web-based tools, explicitly stating calculation processes and proof procedures for each.",
    "Learners can recontextualize developed learning objects into at least two educational scenarios (e.g., function modeling, probability experiments) and propose mathematical approaches for solving real-life problems.",
    "Learners can verify the pedagogical suitability and mathematical accuracy of project outputs through peer review and self-reflection, derive error analyses, and propose improvement plans.",
    "Learners can upload over 20 mathematics learning materials to a cloud-based storage (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive), systematically assign at least five metadata tags (e.g., mathematical topic [calculus, statistics], difficulty level [beginner/intermediate/advanced], file format [PDF, video], key formula, application field) to each, and build a retrievable system with 90% accuracy."
