    "Through project-based assessment (4 weeks), learners select one real-world public/nonprofit task (e.g., community service optimization, resource allocation efficiency), design a solution using AI tools (chatbots, data analysis), and submit a deliverable (report or prototype). They achieve ≥4/5 points in four of five rubric items (problem definition, AI applicability, feasibility, creativity, completeness).",
    "Learners identify three specific privacy issues arising from AI tools (ChatGPT, facial recognition systems) and write a 1,500-character report proposing ≥2 solutions (e.g., encryption, access hierarchy, data minimization) per issue. The report must earn \"excellent\" in ≥4 of 5 rubric items (clarity, validity, practicality, creativity, format)."
