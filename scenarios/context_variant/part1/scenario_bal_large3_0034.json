    "Ensure alignment (80%+ achievement) between learning objectives, assessments, and activities through competency-based curriculum development",
    "Design efficient knowledge delivery methods for large learner groups (30+) in mobile microlearning environments",
    "Learners can design a draft orientation process that simultaneously maintains organizational missions (performing over 80% of core tasks) and reduces costs (15% decrease in operational expenses) under a 1-week workforce reduction scenario (assuming 20% cuts) and achieve an \"excellent\" rating in at least two out of three predefined evaluation criteria: efficiency, effectiveness, and cost-efficiency."
