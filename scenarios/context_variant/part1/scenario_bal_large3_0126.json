  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can propose three or more strategies to restructure mathematics educational content (equations, graphs, statistics, etc.) based on the C5 model and enhance computational and proof strategies.",
    "Learners can design learner-engaged digital environments (Zoom polling, Padlet, etc.) according to connectionist principles to visualize and analyze mathematical problem-solving processes.",
    "Learners can develop two types of math creativity-enhancing class activities (e.g., probability games, spatial reasoning tasks) applying the AAA model (Analyze-Assemble-Application) and integrate formula application and data interpretation skills.",
    "Learners can perform peer feedback using evaluation rubrics based on Thai teacher professional standards and apply assessment criteria for mathematical thinking (calculation, reasoning, analysis)."
