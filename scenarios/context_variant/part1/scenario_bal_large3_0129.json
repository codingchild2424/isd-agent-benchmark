    "Learners can analyze performance metrics (task completion time, error rate) and cognitive load metrics (NASA-TLX survey scores) in VR-based training simulations, derive correlations, and propose at least two training strategies (e.g., difficulty adjustment, added rest periods) based on the analysis."
