    "Learners will specify ≥3 constraints when designing motor learning environments using scientific methodologies (variable control, control group setup, repeated measures), submit an experiment design reflecting these constraints, and achieve ≥80% suitability in peer reviews and expert evaluations.",
    "Learners will apply nonlinear pedagogical principles (iterative feedback, adaptive learning paths) and scientific inquiry methods (hypothesis-experiment-analysis-conclusion) to develop personalized training program drafts for 3 learner profiles within 4 weeks, meeting expert evaluation criteria (≥80% design suitability, ≥70% feasibility).",
    "Learners will understand representative learning design concepts and apply them to real-world cases based on exercise physiology evidence (muscle activation data, movement efficiency measurements, etc.)."
