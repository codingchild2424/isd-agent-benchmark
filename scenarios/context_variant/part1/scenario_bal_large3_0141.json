Parallels asynchronous online learning (video lectures/quizzes) and offline collaboration (role-playing/feedback sessions) in digital device-provided environments. Focuses on enhancing learners' expressive skills (speaking/writing), text interpretation abilities, and instructional design capabilities. Applies evidence-based teaching principles throughout the curriculum.",

    "Learners complete ≥80% of language pedagogy content (grammar/vocabulary instruction, text analysis) on a MOOC platform to strengthen scientific inquiry-based lesson design competencies.",
    "Learners present practical lesson design plans (integrating reading·writing activities and expression strategies) in offline discussions twice a week through study circle activities, derive improved versions reflecting peer feedback.",
    "Learners develop language education materials (1 grammar worksheet, 1 text-based reading passage, 1 writing rubric) via peer assessment in a blended environment (online collaboration tools + face-to-face workshops) over 4 weeks, and share final versions meeting ≥80% peer feedback incorporation per team."
