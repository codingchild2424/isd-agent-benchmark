    "Learners develop the competency to search for similar cases in a case library and apply them to solving new problems.",
    "In groups of 3–4, learners collaboratively propose argumentative solutions (3+ steps) for three given math problems (10 minutes per problem) and suggest at least one logical rebuttal and improvement (2+ sentences) on peers’ approaches, deriving two conceptual connections (e.g., functions-equations, geometry-algebra). This process is repeated three times within a week, with evaluations requiring at least 2/3 points on a rubric (clarity, logic, creativity)."
