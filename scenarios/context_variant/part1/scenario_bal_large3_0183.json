    "Learners enhance learning motivation by more than 20% through scientific inquiry activities in web-based learning environments",
    "During a two-week mid-term course, learners will complete two challenging tasks per week (e.g., R&D problem-solving simulations), engage in three or more curiosity-inducing content analyses (science quizzes, case studies), achieve 80%+ participation in interactive learning activities (discussions, feedback sessions) with peers, and create/execute a self-directed learning plan.",
    "Over three weeks, learners will establish project plans for real-world industrial problems (e.g., factory cooling system optimization) applying thermodynamics (energy efficiency calculations) and fluid dynamics (fluid loss analysis), and propose creative solutions that pass peer evaluation (80+ points from four or more out of five peers) and expert review (80+ points from one energy engineering PhD)."
