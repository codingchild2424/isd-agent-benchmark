    "Apply GSS (General Science and Technology)-based analytical, evaluative, and creative skills to solve chemistry problems, integrating scientific inquiry methods and citizen participation strategies for societal issues.",
    "Enhance the ability to critically analyze complex chemical phenomena using digital learning models, apply findings to social contexts (e.g., community conflict resolution), and propose institutional improvements.",
    "Learners will understand 3 IBL-GSS (Inquiry-Based Learning-GSS) strategies (individual inquiry, collaborative inquiry, case-based inquiry) and apply ≥2 to a given social issue (e.g., community conflict resolution). They will produce an inquiry report (≥80% completeness) including social relations, citizen rights, institutional improvements, and cultural contexts."
