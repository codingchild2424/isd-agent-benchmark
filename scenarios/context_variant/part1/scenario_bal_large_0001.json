  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Fundamental digital device usage, language instruction experience (grammar-vocabulary teaching, text analysis, scientific inquiry methods), and basic proficiency in digital assessment tools",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course strengthening digital technology-integrated language education design competencies for educational administrators/leaders. Project-based assessments produce practical outcomes (writing, reading, expression-enhancing content). It includes text-based peer feedback, multilingual resource case studies, and emphasizes integrating scientific inquiry methods (evidence-based analysis, variable control, conclusion-drawing) into language education.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can design three or more student-centered language learning activities (integrated reading-writing, expressive skill enhancement, text structure analysis) using digital tools (e.g., vocabulary analysis software, writing platforms).",
    "Learners can operate peer evaluation and feedback processes (grammar/vocabulary/structure analysis, evidence-based assessment criteria application) using LMS-based collaboration tools (e.g., Google Classroom, Padlet).",
    "Learners can apply three TTPK (Technology-Pedagogical Content Knowledge) principles (e.g., interactivity, accessibility, feedback systems) to collaboratively develop digital content plans (goal: reading comprehension improvement, tool: AI writing tools, evaluation: text analysis criteria and variable control) within a week, achieving 4+ points (5-point scale) in peer evaluations."
