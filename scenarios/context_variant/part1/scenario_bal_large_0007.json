    "Learners can recognize uncertainties arising during the design process and propose at least three internal/external strategies to overcome them.",
    "Over a six-month course, learners will write reflective journals twice monthly, analytically describing their design identity (three core elements) and professional development (skills/attitudes/knowledge aspects) in approximately 500 characters, achieving an average of over 4 points on peer feedback and instructor evaluation (5-point scale).",
    "Learners will recognize three complex emotions (e.g., anxiety, anticipation, frustration) arising in uncertain situations (e.g., workplace changes, social conflicts) and design at least two practical strategies (e.g., emotion journaling, goal-resetting techniques) to convert them into learning motivation, receiving over 80% positive peer feedback."
