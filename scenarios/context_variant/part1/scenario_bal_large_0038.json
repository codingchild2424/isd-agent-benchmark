  "title": "[Large-Scale] VR-Based Mining Safety Training Expert Program: System and Relationship-Centered Approach for Strengthening Social Responsibility and Public Safety",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Knowledge of basic mining safety protocols and equipment operation experience, foundational understanding of industrial safety regulations and social responsibilities, and basic familiarity with citizen-participatory policy design and community relations management",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A blended education model combining VR practical modules with theoretical knowledge, simulating real mining environments. Stresses safety impacts on communities/ecosystems, integrates political/economic/cultural context analyses, and prioritizes collaborative institutional improvement plans among learners.",
    "institution_type": "Public/Non-profit educational institution",
    "learner_age": "In their 30s",
    "learner_education": "University",
    "learner_role": "Student",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Analyze virtual mining disaster scenarios in VR environments, perform safety response procedures with over 90% accuracy, and propose safety culture dissemination plans from a social responsibility perspective, including measures considering citizen rights protection and community collaboration systems.",
    "Identify five major risk factors (collapses, gas leaks, fires, etc.) in mining workplaces, explain prevention strategies, and design risk management systems considering community safety, incorporating a comprehensive evaluation framework for economic and environmental impacts.",
    "Through team-based projects, design and evaluate VR training modules for improving mining safety protocols, integrating citizen-participatory safety education plans, and emphasize developing educational content reflecting cultural and political contexts."
