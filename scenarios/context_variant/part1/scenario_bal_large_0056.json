  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Advanced expertise in science (experimental design, data analysis, scientific inquiry process), basic digital literacy, and foundational understanding of scientific inquiry support strategies for students with learning disabilities (variable control, hypothesis formulation assistance, etc.)",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A tailored online educational environment for professionals, focusing on evaluating and designing activity-based science inquiry pedagogy that considers accessibility for students with learning disabilities. The program aims to enhance scientific thinking (observation-analysis-conclusion) and real-world problem-solving skills, emphasizing core inquiry processes like experimentation, observation, and variable control to maximize educational effectiveness.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Identify at least three types of activity-based science inquiry lessons (e.g., experimental observation, hypothesis verification, variable control) suitable for the cognitive characteristics of students with learning disabilities, and explain implementation strategies based on the scientific inquiry process (observation-hypothesis-experiment-analysis-conclusion).",
    "Over a 6-month course, learners can complete a blended learning model in an LMS environment by: (1) forming small groups of 3–5 members to collaboratively write two science lab reports using collaboration tools (meeting ≥80% rubric criteria, emphasizing variable control and data analysis), (2) selecting individual research topics and writing one report applying the scientific method (observation-hypothesis-experiment-conclusion, meeting ≥70% on the assessment rubric, emphasizing evidence-based conclusions), (3) creating and delivering a 10-minute presentation (with ≥10 slides) based on experimental results (peer evaluation ≥4/5, assessing analytical and expressive skills), and (4) participating in four formative weekly quizzes (80%+ accuracy on science concepts and experimental procedures, evaluating inquiry skills).",
    "Develop a three-tiered evaluation framework (process-outcome-transfer) to assess how the diversity and frequency of activity-based teaching methods influence science inquiry skills (observation, measurement, analysis, conclusion drawing). Propose scientific evidence collection and evaluation methods for each tier."
