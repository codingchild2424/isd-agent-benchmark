  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Design principles (balance/contrast), basic software experience (mobile apps/web tools), function graph interpretation (polynomial/exponential), coordinate system concepts (Cartesian/polar), and ability to solve basic equations",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Practice-oriented education in smartphone-centric limited-technology environments, focusing on project-based learning (PBL) that visually represents mathematical concepts (e.g., function transformations, geometric symmetry). Learners must consider mobile-optimized design (touch interactions, responsive layouts).",

    "learner_role": "Student",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Complete two design projects incorporating mathematical visualization elements (e.g., function graphs such as quadratic/trigonometric functions, geometric shapes such as circles/polygons) using a mobile learning platform.",
    "Graduate learners will complete a mathematical storytelling output within one week using Desmos or GeoGebra, incorporating at least three visual elements (graphs, animations, interactive features) via sliders (parameter adjustments), coordinate system transformation tools, and animation functions, and submit a project meeting at least four of the five peer evaluation rubric items (80% or higher).",
    "During the PBL process, learners will collaborate with peers to provide at least three rounds of feedback focusing on mathematical expression accuracy (e.g., equation notation, unit consistency) and design completeness (e.g., color usage, layout)."
