  "title": "[Large-Scale] Collaborative Design Workshop for Language-Based Self-Reflection Tools in Maker Education: Strengthening Multicultural Learners' Reading and Expression Competencies",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic maker education concepts, UX design foundations, project management experience, foundational language skills (reading, writing, speaking, listening), and basic knowledge of multicultural learners' characteristics and language development stages",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Strengthening Capabilities in Developing Collaborative Tools for Multicultural and Interdisciplinary Environments. Particularly emphasizing tool design that considers the cultural backgrounds and language development stages of language-minority learners, with the goal of integrating text-based interaction and visual expression methods. Includes a Structured Feedback System for Improving Writing Skills and Context-Based Vocabulary Recommendation Features for Reading Support",

    "learner_role": "Office worker (administrative/management)",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Applying a collaborative design (co-design) process, learners must complete a language-based self-reflection tool design for maker education at least 80%, integrating a feedback mechanism supporting learners’ grammar and vocabulary acquisition.",
    "Learners must develop user-centered solution capabilities aligned with the four UX design phases (analysis–design–prototype–evaluation), particularly strengthening interface design skills reflecting multicultural learners’ reading and expression needs and text-visual integration abilities.",
    "Within four weeks, learners must develop one digital reflection tool prototype (implementing at least three functional requirements) based on needs analysis of a multicultural learner group (minimum five members), then submit verifiable results through user testing (satisfaction rate over 70%). The prototype must include a feedback mechanism supporting grammar/vocabulary acquisition and interaction scenarios reflecting cultural contexts."
