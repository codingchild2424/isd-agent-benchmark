    "Achieve 80% accuracy in APT attack response processes within 3 hours through CRX training based on real-world incident scenarios (emphasizing scientific analysis and digital evidence collection)",
    "Achieve over 75% detection rate of OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities during simulated penetration testing (applying experimental approaches and controlled independent/dependent variables)",
    "Learners apply the scientific methodology of hypothesis formulation → experimental design → data analysis → conclusion drawing in 4-member team-based cyber incident response scenarios. They divide roles, achieve ≥4 points (on a 5-point scale) in 4 out of 5 collaboration rubric criteria (communication, task distribution, problem-solving efficiency), and pass the final evaluation"
