    "additional_context": "Asynchronous/synchronous blended learning environment using mobile devices and LMS (Learning Management System). Provides content applying scientific methodologies such as experimental design, data measurement, and result analysis. Particularly emphasizes integrating scientific inquiry into nursing practice, including patient symptom observation, treatment protocol verification, and clinical evidence collection.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "In blended learning environments, learners can apply scientific inquiry methods (hypothesis setting, variable control, evidence-based analysis) to perform ≥8 topics related to core nursing competencies (medication management, patient assessment, emergency care) with ≥80% accuracy.",
    "Learners can perform self-directed learning ≥2 times per week via mobile microlearning modules and systematically record experimental observations and data analysis results in learning journals.",
    "Learners can demonstrate an achievement rate of 80% or higher in four out of five rubric items assessing critical thinking and clinical judgment skills over 1–6 months through three peer evaluations and two self-assessments in online discussion forums and virtual simulation environments. The evaluation applies five detailed criteria: clarity of hypothesis formulation (20 points), systematicity of evidence collection (20 points), logical consistency (20 points), consideration of alternatives (20 points), and validity of conclusions (20 points)."
