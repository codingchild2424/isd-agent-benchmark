    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Customized learning environments using digital devices, project-based solving of real-life problems (e.g., environmental protection, public facility improvements), and community-linked activities to cultivate social responsibility (citizen participation, rights protection).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners solve real-world application problems (e.g., resource allocation, budget planning) with ≥80% accuracy using computer-based problem-solving systems and develop civic decision-making skills (citizen participation, policy evaluation) through data analysis",
    "Learners improve their ability to apply mathematical concepts (probability, statistics) by one level or more using digital learning tools incorporating gamification elements and develop a sense of responsibility as citizens (community awareness, rights recognition) during collaborative problem-solving",
    "Learners complete a math-based decision-making project (e.g., local traffic improvement plan) in collaboration with peers in a PBL environment and propose creative solutions (considering economic and cultural factors) for community problem-solving"
