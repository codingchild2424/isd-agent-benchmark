  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Secondary-level mathematics fundamentals (algebra, geometry, statistics), minimum 3 years of teaching experience, foundational statistical analysis and ratio calculation pedagogy experience, and basic understanding of probability distributions and equation modeling",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Practical training for in-service math teachers based on the LS-DSC framework. Utilizes math-specific tools like digital whiteboards and tablets for creating statistical graphs, ratio calculation simulations, probability distribution modeling, and automated formative assessment scoring. Provides customized feedback to teachers post-training.",
    "institution_type": "Vocational training institution",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Using LS (Learning Suite) and DSC (Data Science Companion) tools, learners will design one math lesson plan applying basic statistics (mean, standard deviation) and ratio calculations. They will achieve collaborative planning proficiency by earning 4.0+ scores in all rubric items (tool usability, concept application, collaboration) from two peer evaluators on a 5-point scale.",
    "When teaching math concepts (e.g., basic statistics, ratio calculations, probability distributions, equation modeling) in vocational training institutions, learners will analyze individual cognitive needs (beginner/intermediate/advanced) based on pre-diagnostic assessments and use at least three suitability evaluation tools (checklists, observation records, formative assessments) to judge the statistical validity and pedagogical appropriateness of instructional materials.",
    "Reflective practice-based lesson analysis and improvement strategies: Applying math-specific analytical tools for graph interpretation, problem-solving process evaluation, proof method comparison, and probability distribution analysis."
