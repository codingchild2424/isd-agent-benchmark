  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic medical terminology, general English reading comprehension, and foundational understanding of patient symptom assessment (e.g., \"pain scale,\" \"vital sign monitoring\") or treatment protocols (e.g., \"medication administration procedures,\" \"infection control guidelines\")",

    "Learners accurately use medical terminology (e.g., \"myocardial infarction,\" \"diabetes mellitus,\" \"clinical trial\") and diagnostic protocol terms (e.g., \"symptom assessment,\" \"treatment plan,\" \"protocol adherence\") to write 3 abstracts (~500 words each), earning \"excellent\" ratings in ≥4 of 5 evaluation criteria (clarity, accuracy, structure, professionalism, creativity) through peer review and expert evaluation.",
    "Systematic writing following the IMRaD structure of international academic journals and demonstrating clinical applicability of research outcomes (e.g., improving patient treatment protocols, establishing symptom management strategies).",
    "Cultivating syntactic analysis of complex medical sentences, summarization of core content, and evidence-based conclusion drawing from medical literature (e.g., enhancing patient safety, verifying treatment efficacy)."
