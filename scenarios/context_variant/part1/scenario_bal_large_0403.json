    "Development of instructional materials to address math and science learning gaps for students with special needs by applying pre-teaching strategies (e.g., experimental design for identifying independent/dependent variables, utilization of measurement tools)",
    "Learners design a 15-minute integrated science-math simulation (experimental data measurement, analysis, evidence-based conclusion) applying three core strategies of reform-based instruction (collaborative learning, inquiry-based activities, formative assessment) during a mid-term course (3 weeks) and can receive feedback achieving an average of 4 points or higher on a peer evaluation rubric (5-point scale, 5 items)"
