  "title": "[Large-Scale] Business Language Learning Project for Organizational Capacity Building Based on Activity Theory: Integration of Text Analysis, Cross-Cultural Communication, and Practical Writing",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic business communication (meeting facilitation, presentations, report writing) and intra-organizational collaboration experience, understanding of basic grammatical structures and work-related vocabulary, along with text analysis skills and foundational cross-cultural communication knowledge",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A collaborative project within organizational networks applying expanded learning theory. Language learning outcomes are directly measured by organizational communication efficiency (e.g., 20% reduction in email response time, 90% accuracy in meeting minutes). Clarity and cultural appropriateness of business texts (reports, proposals, emails) serve as key evaluation criteria.",

    "learner_age": "In their 20s",
    "learner_education": "Adult learner (non-degree)",
    "learner_role": "Office worker (administrative/management)",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can apply an object-oriented approach from activity theory in cross-organizational collaboration projects to set three work objectives (e.g., process optimization, resource allocation, communication improvement), draft team execution plans (specifying goals, timelines, and responsible parties), and achieve ≥80% goal completion within six months. During this process, they must accurately use ≥5 specialized terms (e.g., activity system, object-oriented approach) and apply ≥3 cross-cultural communication strategies (e.g., cultural context consideration, nonverbal communication). Business writing will be evaluated for grammatical accuracy and specialized vocabulary.",
    "Based on expansive learning theory, analyze historical changes in language usage patterns (lexis, grammar, expression) through observation and intervention strategies, and derive plans to enhance organizational communication efficiency. Propose improvements for report and email clarity via text structure analysis.",
    "Within six months, learners can collaborate with cross-functional teams (marketing, development, customer support) to develop two practical cases linking language learning outcomes (improved English communication skills, enhanced business writing) to organizational capacity. For each case, submit an implementation report (including goals, methods, performance metrics) and receive an effectiveness rating of ≥4/5 from team leaders. Performance metrics include achieving ≥85% accuracy in English communication, reducing business document errors by ≥20%, and improving presentation expressiveness by ≥30%."
