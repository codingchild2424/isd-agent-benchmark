    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Strengthening mobile learning theory and assessment framework-based language education (integrated reading/writing/speaking) design capabilities in smartphone-centric constrained technology environments. Special focus is placed on enhancing expressive skills in digital contexts and developing context-based communication competencies.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Explain how elements to consider in mobile language learning design (grammar-vocabulary integration, context-based expressions, multimodality utilization) based on the FRAME model and TDT theory can be applied to actual language education cases",
    "Design language learning assessment tools applicable in smartphone environments (digital portfolio evaluations, AI-based writing analysis tools) and propose methods to evaluate learners' integrated reading-writing-speaking competencies",
    "Within one week, learners will develop one language education module considering accessibility (colorblindness adaptation, screen reader compatibility) and engagement (three interactive quizzes, two voice feedbacks) for mobile learning design, and submit an implementation report meeting at least four of five peer evaluation rubric criteria (grammatical accuracy, lexical diversity, contextual appropriateness, interactivity, technical accessibility)"
