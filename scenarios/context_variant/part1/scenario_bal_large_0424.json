    "Learners analyze performance data of sports organizations to identify cultural change patterns and establish policy development strategies using statistical inference (regression analysis/hypothesis testing)",
    "Learners collect and analyze stakeholder interaction data during VR simulation-based coaching policy implementation, and can write a report explaining prediction results based on probabilistic models (Bayesian networks/Monte Carlo simulations) with 80% accuracy",
    "Learners design and evaluate sports education policy optimization models (linear/nonlinear programming) using real sports data (e.g., athlete training records, game results) through small-scale team projects"
