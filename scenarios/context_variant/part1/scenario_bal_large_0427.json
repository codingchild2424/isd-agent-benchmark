  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic mathematical concepts (e.g., linear equations, quadratic functions, Pythagorean theorem) and teaching experience, with graph interpretation and basic statistical analysis skills",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learners—ordinary citizens with experience in mathematics education or educational participation—explore instructional design methods. Includes supplementary activities using digital devices (e.g., graphing calculators, GeoGebra math software), focusing on enhancing mathematical thinking (abstraction, generalization) and problem-solving skills (equation solving, geometric proofs).",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Participants must diagnose teaching motivation based on self-determination theory and explain at least two strategies to enhance intrinsic motivation during math problem-solving (e.g., open-ended equation problems, real-life function models).",
    "Participants must interpret regression analysis results from surveys and analyze their correlation with math instructional design methods (e.g., geometric visualization materials, step-by-step equation-solving strategies).",
    "Within a one-week course, learners must develop one instructional design model applicable to middle school math classes (equations, functions, geometry), prepare a 10–15-page presentation meeting at least four of five evaluation criteria (mathematical accuracy, creativity, practicality, clarity, interactivity) from peer and expert reviews, and deliver a 10-minute presentation."
