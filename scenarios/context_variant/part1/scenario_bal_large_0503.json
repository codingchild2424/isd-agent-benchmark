    "For 3 weekly case study assignments on physiological responses (e.g., post-exercise heart rate changes, stress hormone secretion), learners create concept maps linking them to 5 key physiological principles (homeostasis, hormonal regulation, nervous system responses, immune responses, energy metabolism), reflect ≥3 peer feedbacks, and submit a revised version within 2 weeks meeting ≥4 rubric criteria (clarity, accuracy, creativity, completeness, feedback incorporation) at a \"B+\" level or higher."
