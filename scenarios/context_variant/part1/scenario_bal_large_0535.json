    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Enhanced interaction through online discussion forums while conducting science projects in digital learning environments, sharing processes of experimental design, data measurement/analysis, and conclusion drawing. Particularly emphasizes variable control and evidence collection to foster scientific rigor.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners post opinions on hypothesis formulation and experiment design for science projects at least three times in a digital discussion forum, specifying variable control and measurement methods.",
    "Learners provide constructive feedback—including evidence-based analysis and scientific validity—on peers’ posts five or more times.",
    "Learners select five or more ideas from ten collected in a discussion forum, apply the scientific inquiry process (problem definition → hypothesis formulation → variable control → experiment design → data analysis → conclusion derivation), and complete a five-page A4 project report and presentation materials within a week, meeting four or more of six evaluation criteria."
