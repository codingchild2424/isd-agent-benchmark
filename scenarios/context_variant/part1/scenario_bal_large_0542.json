  "title": "[Large-scale] Design of Flipped Learning-based Biology Learning Strategies: Strengthening Social Collaboration, Citizen Science Competencies, and Educational Leadership Development",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational biology theory and research methods, basic concepts of social interaction (civic engagement, community collaboration) and collaborative learning, and foundational skills in social science analysis (historical, geographical, and cultural contexts)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course for advanced professionals in managerial/leadership roles to strengthen biology education design capabilities. Focuses on developing educational leadership to disseminate scientific literacy within social systems (political, economic, cultural institutions). Requires strategy development considering learners' cultural diversity and institutional contexts (regional education policies). Includes applications of real-world social problem-solving through citizen science projects.",
    "institution_type": "Corporate/Enterprise",
    "learner_age": "40s and above",
    "learner_education": "Middle school",
    "learner_role": "Office worker (administrative/management)",
    "domain_expertise": "Beginner"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners analyze flipped learning components (pre-lectures, quizzes, group activities) and design integration strategies for biology education using social science approaches (history, geography, cultural contexts).",
    "Over 4 weeks, learners design 3+ collaborative activities (linked to citizen science projects) on corporate online platforms (e.g., Microsoft Teams). They develop social learning strategies achieving 80%+ participant satisfaction and 70%+ discussion engagement rates for local community problem-solving.",
    "Learners build a framework to measure biology learning outcomes using project-based assessment tools reflecting cultural/geographical diversity. They propose sustainable education system improvements (considering political/economic systems) and strategies for fostering learning communities."
