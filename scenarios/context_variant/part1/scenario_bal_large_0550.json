    "Learners can enhance their ability to analyze complex social problems and systematically design solutions in a VR simulation environment.",
    "During the mid-term process (2–4 weeks), learners perform two project-based assessments, document three specific ambiguities encountered during problem-solving, submit a 2-page self-reflection report outlining strategies to overcome them, and achieve a 'B' (70+ points) grade in four out of five rubric criteria"
