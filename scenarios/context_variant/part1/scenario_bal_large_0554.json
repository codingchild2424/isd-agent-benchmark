    "Learners can systematically analyze science domain problems and derive solutions by applying design thinking methodologies",
    "Over 4 weeks, learners collaborate in multidisciplinary teams (3–5 members: engineering, social sciences, design, etc.) following the PBL process (problem definition → idea generation → solution development → evaluation) to create actionable project proposals for solving community issues (e.g., optimizing waste segregation). They incorporate ≥3 rounds of field expert feedback and submit final reports.",
    "During a 2–4-week midterm course, learners establish 3 measurable social impact metrics (e.g., community participation rate, energy savings, number of program beneficiaries) for science project outcomes, collecting quantitative data (surveys, monitoring records) to evaluate them with ≥80% reliability."
