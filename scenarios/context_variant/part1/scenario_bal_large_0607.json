  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic medical terminology (symptoms, diagnosis, treatment) and understanding of clinical workflows, essential expression and vocabulary skills for patient interviews (symptom description, medical history taking), and awareness of formal/informal communication differences in healthcare settings",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Simulation/VR-based",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Compares community healthcare scenarios (patient education, preventive medicine counseling) with hospital simulations (emergency situations, multidisciplinary consultations) in smartphone-based VR environments. Analyzes precise medical language use (terminology, patient communication styles) and context-appropriate expressions (empathetic vs. directive language) required in clinical settings.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Identify and execute at least three professional communication skills required in community-based clinical settings (e.g., patient history-taking, symptom explanation, treatment plan delivery) using medical terminology and context-specific expressions.",
    "Compare and analyze at least three communication methods in hospital and community healthcare settings (e.g., medical protocols, patient-provider interactions, cultural contexts) through VR simulations, reinforcing specialized terminology and logical expression.",
    "Write a one-page career plan reflecting changes in personal career preferences, applying medical field-specific terminology and structured expression formats."
