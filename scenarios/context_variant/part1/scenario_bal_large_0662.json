    "Improve content organization efficiency of an online biology course by ≥20% through probabilistic distribution and optimization modeling analysis via 3 iterative improvements.",
    "Derive optimal learning activity designs based on confidence intervals after verifying statistical significance via t-tests and ANOVA by comparing experimental and control groups using A/B testing.",
    "Perform multiple regression analysis on learning performance indicators of a revised course using corporate internal data (completion rate ≥85%, assessment score ≥70) during a 2-week project period and produce a data-driven report proposing improvement plans for ≥3 out of 5 core indicators."
