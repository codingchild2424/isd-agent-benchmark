  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic accounting principles, understanding of financial systems, scientific analysis methods (observation, hypothesis formulation, variable control), and data interpretation skills",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "In a simulation environment based on real corporate financial data, learners apply scientific methodologies (systematic observation, hypothesis testing, controlled variable experiments) to accumulate practical financial decision-making experience. Training emphasizes enhancing decision reliability through evidence collection and quantitative analysis.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can systematically prepare financial reports according to accounting policies in various financial scenarios and analyze experimental data.",
    "In accounting ethics dilemmas, learners can apply the scientific inquiry method (hypothesis → observation → analysis → conclusion) to derive professional judgment criteria and make evidence-based decisions.",
    "In corporate crisis scenarios, learners can establish stakeholder coordination and collaboration strategies, present optimal solutions based on experimental data with controlled variables."
