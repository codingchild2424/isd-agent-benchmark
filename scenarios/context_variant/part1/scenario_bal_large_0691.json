  "learning_goals": [
    "With ≥85% participation, learners perform conflict management and decision-making simulations on a gamification platform to enhance leadership competencies and civic consciousness",
    "By Week 4, learners can derive ≥3 context-based design strategies for situational problem-solving (organizational culture, resource allocation, stakeholder management, institutional frameworks)",
    "By course completion, learners achieve ≥80% completion rate in leadership scenario games (team-building, crisis response, social responsibility) through ≥20 hours of self-directed exploration activities",
    "By the end of the 6-month long-term course, learners apply all five core elements of a gamification design framework (e.g., MDA Framework: mechanics, dynamics, aesthetics, technology, goals) to plan a team collaboration simulation (organizational structure analysis, role distribution, communication strategies, institutional impact assessment) and submit a project meeting ≥2 of 3 evaluation criteria (creativity, feasibility, collaboration efficiency)"
