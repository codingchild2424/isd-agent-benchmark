  "learning_goals": [
    "Using design thinking processes and language analysis skills (text structure analysis, specialized vocabulary utilization), learners clearly express at least two creative solutions to engineering problems.",
    "Through activity-based team projects, learners identify real-world industry problems, apply effective communication strategies (collaborative discussion, presentation skills), and concretize at least one business model.",
    "Performing learning activities corresponding to Bloom’s higher taxonomy levels (analysis, evaluation, creation), learners utilize critical thinking and specialized vocabulary (technical/business terms) to evaluate and refine technology-based startup ideas."
