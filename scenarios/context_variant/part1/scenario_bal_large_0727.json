    "Enhance digital design competencies for mathematical concepts (3D geometry modeling, dynamic equation visualization, statistical distribution simulation, probabilistic reasoning) with ≥20% improvement in pre-post assessments.",
    "For a medium-sized group of 20 learners, select ≥3 flexible teaching strategies (e.g., differentiated instruction: tiered problem sets and proof difficulty adjustments; collaborative learning: graph interpretation group tasks and data analysis discussions; project-based learning: statistical analysis reports and visualization deliverables), and design teaching strategies that meet ≥4 out of 5 evaluation criteria (clarity, feasibility, effectiveness, mathematical accuracy, technology integration) through peer and instructor assessments."
