  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic digital literacy, foundational understanding of educational contexts, and introductory knowledge of social studies core concepts (citizenship, cultural diversity, historical awareness, geospatial analysis, etc.)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Designed for pre-service vocational teachers, smartphone-based practice-oriented curriculum. Highlights AI applications in social studies contexts (historical document analysis, geographic data visualization, economic statistical modeling). Focuses on cultivating competencies to design citizen-participatory projects for solving local community issues.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Explain the principles and ethical considerations of applying generative AI in education within a social studies context (e.g., citizenship, cultural diversity, historical context).",
    "Implement a three-stage personalized instructional design process (needs analysis → activity design → assessment planning) using AI tools and apply it to social studies inquiry activities (e.g., historical analysis, geographic data visualization).",
    "Through four weeks of collaborative project-based learning, learners will develop one social studies lesson design plan utilizing AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, data visualization tools) and achieve an average score of 4 or higher on a 5-point rubric evaluating three civic competencies: digital literacy, critical thinking, and collaboration skills."
