    "Learners explain core components of the flipped learning model (pre-learning materials, activity-based classes) and scientific inquiry methods (hypothesis formulation, variable control, experimental design) with ≥80% accuracy",
    "Through group discussions with peer teachers, learners apply core psychology concepts (cognitive development, learning theories, etc.) to actual classroom cases and perform observational and evidence-based analysis (data collection, conclusion derivation)",
    "Based on theories acquired via pre-learning videos and quizzes, learners participate ≥90% in role-play activities in classrooms, experiencing independent/dependent variable control and hypothesis verification processes"
