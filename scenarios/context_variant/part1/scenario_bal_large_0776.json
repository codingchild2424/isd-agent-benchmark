    "They can mathematically model real-world industrial problems and design optimization solutions.",
    "They enhance communication skills using collaboration tools while performing team-based mathematical design projects.",
    "Using the four stages of Design-Based Learning (DBL) (problem definition, modeling, simulation, validation), learners will apply mathematical theories (e.g., linear programming, probability models) to solve ≥3 industry field problems (e.g., process optimization, resource allocation). Solutions must achieve ≥80% in two of three evaluation criteria: validity, practicality, and accuracy."
