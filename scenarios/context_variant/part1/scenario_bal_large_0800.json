  "learning_goals": [
    "Design a learner-customized feedback system utilizing an adaptive learning platform",
    "Within one week, learners develop one project-based learning scenario for social studies history/geography using virtual/augmented reality tools (CoSpaces, Unity, etc.), and submit a result that meets four or more of the five evaluation criteria provided in peer reviews and expert evaluations.",
    "At the end of the one-week course, learners analyze three provided learning data samples to create a five-level rubric (four criteria, each rated on a 1–5 scale) for assessing learner autonomy, and receive validity recognition of an average of 4 points or higher from two peer evaluators.",
    "Within one week, learners design strategies for managing large learner groups of 100+ using digital collaboration tools like Google Workspace and Microsoft Teams (including task allocation, progress monitoring, feedback systems), and demonstrate feasibility through peer evaluation and instructor verification."
