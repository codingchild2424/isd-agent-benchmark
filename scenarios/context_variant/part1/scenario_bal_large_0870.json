    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Classrooms enabling team-based learning in BYOD environments, customized activity design based on Kolb’s learning styles, case-based scenarios for solving community health issues (infectious disease management, elderly healthcare welfare, etc.), and civic literacy development through simulations of medical ethical dilemmas.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will apply prepared medical content to real clinical contexts using the PLHET model, developing scientific diagnostic and treatment plans that consider social factors such as patient rights, medical ethics, and cultural diversity.",
    "Learners will collaboratively engage in activities tailored to Kolb’s four learning styles (divergent, assimilative, convergent, accommodative) to holistically understand connections between complex medical concepts and healthcare systems/policies/community relations, and explore citizen participation strategies for addressing health disparities.",
    "Learners will complete three team-based problem-solving activities during a mid-term course (three weeks), produce a performance report meeting at least four of five self-directed learning competency checklist items (goal setting, resource utilization, feedback incorporation, citizenship, cultural sensitivity), and submit an additional community health promotion project proposal."
