    "Learners analyze three vocational training institution case studies (digital literacy, welding skills, elder care) under a 1 million KRW budget and 4-week time constraint. Applying a five-step problem-solving framework (problem definition-cause analysis-solution generation-action plan-evaluation), they create an operational plan including a budget allocation table (within 10% error per item) and a 4-week schedule. The plan must score 12+ points (out of 15) on the institution's evaluation rubric (clarity, feasibility, budget efficiency)."
