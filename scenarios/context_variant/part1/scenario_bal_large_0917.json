  "title": "[Large-Scale] Technical Communication and Language Expression Course for Strengthening Practical Computer Networking Skills",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic TCP/IP concepts, understanding of the OSI 7-layer model, experience in office network management, technical document comprehension, basic presentation skills, and foundational proficiency in technical terminology",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners document and clearly explain small-office network topologies using specialized networking terminology and technical vocabulary.",
    "Learners systematically describe packet tracer analysis results in technical reports and diagnose network latency issues within three steps.",
    "Learners articulate departmental network segmentation plans (verbally/written) using specialized terms acquired from VLAN setup practice.",
    "Teams present SDN simulation results with visual aids, reorganizing technical content for non-expert comprehension."
