  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Knowledge of fundamental nursing theories and clinical practice experience, along with foundational understanding of scientific inquiry methodologies (systematic observation, hypothesis formulation, experimental design, data analysis)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A practice-oriented training course for corporate nursing educators or pre-service nursing instructors. Applies innovative pedagogical methods combining medical protocols and scientific methodologies (experimental design, evidence analysis, variable control). Learning outcomes are comprehensively measured through quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.",
    "institution_type": "Corporate/Enterprise",
    "learner_age": "In their 30s",
    "learner_education": "High school",
    "learner_role": "Office worker (administrative/management)",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Apply patient safety-focused nursing interventions with ≥80% accuracy in simulation environments, and evaluate scientific observation and evidence-based nursing protocols through variable analysis.",
    "Successfully perform emergency response procedures ≥3 times using high-fidelity simulation equipment, and explore optimal treatment plans through variable control based on experimental design principles.",
    "Learners self-evaluate their simulation performance results in three core areas (accuracy, efficiency, and collaboration) during the debriefing session, develop at least two specific improvement plans based on the evaluation results, and derive and statistically analyze three or more performance metrics (e.g., processing time, error rate, team satisfaction) using provided data analysis tools (Excel, Tableau, etc.).",
    "In team-based simulations, learners effectively execute role distribution and communication strategies at least twice, and evaluate the collaborative problem-solving process using the scientific inquiry method of hypothesis setting-verification-conclusion drawing."
