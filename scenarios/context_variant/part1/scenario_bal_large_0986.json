  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can design one vocabulary intervention program for a specific job field (e.g., marketing, technology) using word classification strategies (e.g., semantic/part-of-speech/frequency-based sorting) and submit a design meeting four or more of five expert review criteria (clarity, practicality, systematicity, etc.).",
    "Learners can develop three or more teaching-learning materials (e.g., flashcards, picture books, interactive tools) reflecting vocabulary development characteristics of low-income preschoolers (ages 3–6) and submit results meeting four or more of five expert review criteria (suitability, creativity, practicality, accessibility, scalability) within six months.",
    "Explain strategies to enhance children's reasoning abilities through categorization-based vocabulary learning activities",
    "Learners can design and implement a customized vocabulary intervention strategy applying a spaced repetition system (SRS) and gamification elements for a group of 50–100 learners within a company via Zoom/LMS platforms over three months, improve weekly vocabulary test averages by 20%, and simultaneously meet participation (80%+ weekly activity completion) and satisfaction (4+/5 survey score) standards."
