  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic architectural design and construction processes, foundational concepts of scientific inquiry methods (experimental design, data analysis, hypothesis verification), and comprehension of variable classification (independent/dependent/control variables)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Necessity of building a learning environment highly connected to current practitioners' work: Provides case studies applying scientific methodologies to actual construction projects (e.g., LEED certification cases) and experimental data analysis tools (SPSS/R/Python). Emphasizes the scientific inquiry process of observation recording, evidence collection, and conclusion drawing.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Derive and explain at least three key decision-making factors at each stage of the design-build integrated process: control of independent/dependent variables, experimental design for hypothesis verification, and application of data-driven decision-making processes.",
    "Scientific observation and hypothesis formulation using real-world cases → critical reflection journaling followed by improvement suggestions: emphasize measurable indicators (e.g., carbon emissions) and evidence-based analysis (statistical significance verification).",
    "Within 3 weeks, learners develop one construction project design-build scenario reflecting sustainability standards (20% reduction in carbon emissions, 70% or higher resource recycling rate) and social responsibility (community impact assessment report). They submit deliverables meeting at least four of five predefined evaluation checklist items (environmental impact analysis, economic feasibility, community acceptance, technical viability, legal compliance). Additionally, they apply experimental design (data collection planning) and result analysis methodologies (t-test/ANOVA for statistical significance verification)."
