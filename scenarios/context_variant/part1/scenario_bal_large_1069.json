  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of fundamental theories and research methodologies in science, basic knowledge of experimental design and data analysis (variable control, measurement tool utilization), and experience with online collaboration tools",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Strengthening real-time online collaboration and social interaction for current science professionals, developing critical thinking through the scientific inquiry process (observation-hypothesis-experiment-analysis-conclusion). Emphasizes experimental reproducibility and rigor in data interpretation.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners design and execute an online PBL project applying the scientific inquiry process (hypothesis formulation, independent/dependent variable control, experimental design) to solve real-world scientific problems",
    "Learners can collaborate with two peers to solve three science problems using socially shared metacognitive scaffolding strategies (e.g., role division, feedback routines), producing a report that meets at least four of five critical thinking checklist items based on evidence-based analysis (referencing ≥2 experimental datasets) and logical reasoning (applying deductive/inductive methods).",
    "Learners evaluate and present project outcomes and improvement strategies based on quantitative data measurements and statistical analyses, following a structured feedback format."
