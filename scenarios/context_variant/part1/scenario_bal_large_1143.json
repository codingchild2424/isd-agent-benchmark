  "title": "[Large-scale] UDL-Based Secondary STEM Instructional Design Capacity-Building Course: Teaching Design for Improving Mathematical Problem-Solving Skills",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational understanding of secondary education curricula, mastery of core mathematics concepts (equations, functions, geometry, statistics), experience applying UDL principles and digital tools, and basic graph interpretation and statistical calculation abilities",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "In a BYOD environment, developing educational design competencies that consider diverse learner types (visual/auditory/kinesthetic disabilities, etc.) through mobile device utilization. For math content, multiple representation methods are applied, such as text-to-speech conversion, visual graph representations, and tactile learning materials. Notably, accessibility-enhancing tools include step-by-step voice guidance for equation solving, 3D modeling tools for geometry concepts, and interactive chart generators for statistical analysis.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners create a mathematics instructional design plan applying the three UDL principles (representation, action & expression, engagement), incorporating problem-solving activities using core concepts (equations, functions, geometry) and formula applications.",
    "Learners develop three mobile microlearning contents (basic/intermediate/advanced) for vocational training institutions targeting learners in their 20s, each under five minutes, incorporating at least two activities (graph interpretation, probability calculation, statistical analysis) reflecting learner needs survey results (80%+ response rate). Statistical analysis emphasizes data visualization tools.",
    "Learners analyze three or more STEM teaching materials using UDL Checklist 3.0, propose at least two improvements per UDL principle (engagement, representation, action & expression) meeting two of three rubric criteria (clarity, feasibility, effectiveness). For accessibility in mathematical proofs/formula applications/problem-solving, they suggest at least one visual aid (e.g., graphing calculator) or alternative representation method (e.g., text-to-formula converter)."
