    "Applying instructional design principles (ADDIE model, SAM model, etc.), learners can select three educational videos for Parkinson’s patients and write a quality evaluation report achieving an \"excellent\" rating (4/5 points) in ≥4 out of 5 evaluation criteria (clarity, accessibility, engagement, medical accuracy, cultural appropriateness).",
    "Learners will apply patient-centered design principles (accessibility, personalization, interactivity) in public/nonprofit educational contexts over six months, designing one prototype (including storyboard/wireframe) for online learning content development and obtaining feedback averaging 4.0 or higher on a 5-point scale from an expert evaluation panel."
