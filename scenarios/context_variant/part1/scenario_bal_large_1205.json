    "Perform ≥3 language structure optimization projects in VR simulations, implementing contextual coherence and reader-friendly design.",
    "Learners provide evidence-based feedback on three peers’ language design works using a design expertise rubric, evaluating grammatical accuracy (≥80%), information efficiency (≥3/4 on a 4-point scale), and visual expressiveness (≥2/3 criteria). Feedback includes vocabulary diversity and syntactic complexity analysis."
