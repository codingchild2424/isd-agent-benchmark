    "Acquire the ability to model quadratic functions through the analysis of baseball pitch trajectories",
    "Distinguish pitch types (fastball/slider) with 80% accuracy using simulation tasks created with video occlusion techniques",
    "Learners will apply mathematical modeling techniques (linear programming, graph theory, etc.) acquired from subtask training to traffic flow optimization problems (e.g., traffic light control system design), produce a three-stage project report (problem definition → mathematical modeling → simulation verification), and achieve an average score of 4/5 or higher in peer and instructor evaluations"
