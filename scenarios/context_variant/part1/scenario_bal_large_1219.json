    "Systematically diagnose current operational status of school libraries, derive educational and social improvement directions, and establish strategies to strengthen civic collaboration networks",
    "Using the five core indicators (space utilization, resource accessibility, program connectivity, community collaboration, curriculum alignment) of the 'Improve Your Library' self-assessment process, learners will draft a school development plan within two weeks and achieve over 80% suitability scores in peer reviews and expert evaluations, with particular emphasis on community collaboration and curriculum alignment indicators",
    "Learners will share assessment results (course satisfaction, achievement data, etc.) with three or more peer vocational training institutions, develop an action plan for building civic collaboration networks, derive and implement two reflective practice strategies, incorporating civic engagement approaches that consider cultural and political contexts"
