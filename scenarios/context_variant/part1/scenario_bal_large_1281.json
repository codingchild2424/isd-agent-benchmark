  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Advanced expertise in language education (experience in teaching grammar, vocabulary, reading, and writing) and foundational knowledge of learning psychology. Understanding of VARK learning style diagnostics",

    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Customized design for enhancing language education capabilities for current professionals. Analyzes the impact of social experiences and personal beliefs on language learning outcomes (communication skills, text comprehension, expression abilities) using structural equation modeling. Develops educational strategies to improve learners' grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, and writing skills",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can apply the three elements of psychological processes (personal commitment, effective functioning, personal effort) to actual language learning contexts (reading, writing, listening, speaking) to enhance communication skills.",
    "Learners use structural equation modeling to analyze and visualize causal relationships between social experiences and language learning outcomes (grammar acquisition, vocabulary expansion, expressive ability, text comprehension).",
    "In project-based assessments (teams of 3–4 learners), learners design two customized language learning strategies (e.g., listening enhancement/vocabulary expansion strategies) based on VARK learning style diagnostic results and psychological processes (motivation, cognitive load, etc.). After a two-week implementation, they submit effectiveness evaluation reports (based on a 5-item checklist) for each strategy."
