  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can analyze success and failure cases to solve complex language-related problems (e.g., text analysis, argument structure errors) and apply strategies to similar problems while considering lexical diversity and grammatical accuracy.",
    "Learners can structure initial claims, counterarguments, and rebuttals (each approximately 300 characters) for three academic paper or discussion topics, visualize argument maps, and achieve an average of over 4 points on a 5-point scale in peer and instructor evaluations (criteria: clarity, logic, creativity, lexical diversity, grammatical accuracy).",
    "Learners can creatively propose new language problem-solving strategies based on lessons from failure cases (e.g., text misinterpretation, logical leaps, expression errors)."
