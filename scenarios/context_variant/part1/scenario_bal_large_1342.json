  "learning_goals": [
    "Explain the physiological principles of ECMO equipment and critical care management procedures with 90% accuracy, and present clinical application procedures based on patient safety protocols.",
    "In board game simulations, accurately diagnose high-risk ECMO complications (e.g., hemorrhage, thrombosis, infection) with at least 85% accuracy, and establish response plans according to clinical protocols.",
    "Through team-based PBL projects, learners draft an ECMO patient management protocol, develop a final protocol (approximately 10 pages) incorporating at least three core procedures (e.g., blood flow monitoring, anticoagulation management, infection prevention) with feedback from clinical experts, achieve a suitability score of 80% or higher in institutional clinical simulation evaluations, and reflect medical ethics and patient rights protection principles."
