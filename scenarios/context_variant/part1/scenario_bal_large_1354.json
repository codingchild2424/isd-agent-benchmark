  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic language proficiency (grammar/vocabulary), experience in educational content creation, elementary smartphone filming/editing skills, and fundamental text analysis and writing abilities",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "This smartphone-based participatory learning environment emphasizes real-time interaction, collaborative learning, and the improvement of learners' expression and comprehension skills. It fosters language proficiency in diverse contexts through contextual learning approaches using cinematic techniques and stresses integrated development of listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will design narrative structures and dialogue flows for language learning scenarios using the three-act film structure (setup-conflict-resolution), improving vocabulary selection and grammar application appropriate to situational contexts.",
    "Learners will produce narrative-based content that motivates language acquisition by applying character arc techniques (growth/change processes), advancing learners’ composition skills and text analysis abilities.",
    "Learners will develop educational modules combining visual storytelling and language expression (e.g., dialogue scenes, situational expressions) using smartphone filming/editing tools, enhancing expressive and comprehension skills across media."
