  "title": "[Large-Scale] Creativity Development Through Traditional Music: Guqin Learning and Mathematical Rhythm Pattern Analysis via Systematic Integrated Instruction",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic traditional instrument performance, comprehension of music theory, proficiency in fraction/decimal operations and basic graph interpretation, and foundational skills in equation formulation and data analysis",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Simulation/VR-based",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A creativity development program using the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Guqin instrument. Short workshops for practicing professionals to enhance work extensibility. Focuses on improving pattern recognition, spatial reasoning, and creative problem-solving via music-mathematics integration. Particularly aims to expand mathematical thinking through probabilistic rhythm variations and symmetry analysis.",

    "learner_education": "University",
    "learner_role": "Student",
    "domain_expertise": "Beginner"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Over 80% of learners can explain the cultural significance and performance techniques of Guqin by linking them to mathematical ratios (e.g., 3:2 intervals) through equations and graph formats.",
    "All participants can create at least one traditional scale variation composition using VR simulations, express it as fractional/decimal rhythm graphs, and analyze statistical patterns.",
    "Each learner can complete a proof and analysis report on mathematical rhythm patterns (periodicity, symmetry, fractional expressions) utilizing traditional music elements (e.g., pentatonic scales)."
