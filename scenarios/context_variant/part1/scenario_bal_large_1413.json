    "Learners can identify environmental risk factors and provide scientific explanations considering social contexts using three or more explanatory strategies (e.g., comparison, analogy, data visualization).",
    "Learners can analyze survey results on risk perception among university students, select one of three risk types (climate, safety, health), and produce a 500-character explanatory writing sample tailored to that type. The sample must meet at least two of three evaluation criteria: clarity, accuracy, and reader customization.",
    "Learners can provide feedback to improve the clarity and scientific accuracy of explanatory texts through peer assessment."
