    "additional_context": "Emphasizing ICT tools specialized for mathematics (GeoGebra, Desmos, Wolfram Alpha) and reflective practice competencies. It focuses on teaching core math concepts (graph analysis, equation solving, statistical modeling, mathematical proofs) while stressing approaches that simultaneously verify theoretical validity and computational accuracy when using tools.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Design interactive math lessons incorporating function graph visualization, equation modeling, statistical data analysis, and mathematical proof processes using GeoGebra and Desmos, achieving over 80% completion.",
    "When designing ICT-based math learning activities, explain the interconnection among educational objectives (e.g., understanding calculus concepts), tools (e.g., Desmos slider function), and content (e.g., visualizing trigonometric periodicity and linking algebraic expressions) in at least three ways, and propose computational verification methods for each case.",
    "In online real-time classes, learners will select two ICT strategies for math concept feedback (e.g., real-time polls to verify equation-solving processes, screen-sharing annotations for graph interpretation feedback and error analysis), apply each strategy at least once, and achieve over 4 points (on a 5-point scale) in class effectiveness surveys."
