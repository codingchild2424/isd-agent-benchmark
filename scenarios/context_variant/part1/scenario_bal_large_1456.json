  "title": "[Large-scale] Language Communication Project-Based Learning for Strengthening Safety Decision-Making Competencies: Case-Based Incident Analysis",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of safety management fundamentals and industrial field experience, basic technical report writing and presentation skills, and foundational knowledge of specialized terminology and standard sentence structures",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A practice-oriented course for administrators/leaders requiring mobile learning support via smartphones. It emphasizes diverse language communication activities, including team-based discussions, report writing, and oral presentations. Special focus is placed on improving language skills such as professional terminology use, clear expression, and effective negotiation techniques.",
    "institution_type": "Corporate/Enterprise",
    "learner_age": "40s and above",
    "learner_education": "Adult learner (non-degree)",
    "learner_role": "Professional (medical/legal/technical)",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Analyze real-world industrial accident cases to identify over 80% of risk factors, and improve technical report writing and oral presentation skills by enhancing the logical structure and use of specialized terminology based on the analysis",
    "Learners will utilize at least three safety decision-making frameworks (e.g., HAZID, FMEA, SWOT) to propose two response strategies for a given crisis scenario (e.g., chemical spill), reach a consensus solution through negotiation in a 4-person team discussion, and achieve an \"Excellent\" rating in at least two of three evaluation rubric criteria (clarity, feasibility, collaboration efficiency). Special emphasis is placed on strengthening communication skills using specialized terminology and precise expressions during discussions",
    "In team-based projects (4 members per group), learners will develop three actionable language-based solutions (e.g., standardizing terminology, improving emergency response manuals, implementing multilingual support systems) to enhance safety communication programs, select solutions meeting at least two of three evaluation criteria (cost-effectiveness, time efficiency, effectiveness), and write a 5-page feasibility assessment report. Reports must systematically organize content using specialized terminology and clear sentence structures",
    "Post-assessment will confirm that over 90% of participants recognize improvements in safety decision-making processes and demonstrate enhanced language proficiency (grammatical accuracy, lexical diversity, logical organization) in articulating these improvements"
