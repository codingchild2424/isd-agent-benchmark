  "title": "[Large-Scale] Language Practical Competency Enhancement Course Using Simulation-Based Digital Platforms: Text Analysis, Writing, Communication Optimization, and Advanced Expression Strategies",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic language proficiency (grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, writing) and practical experience. Requires digital platform utilization skills and foundational understanding of PBL (Problem-Based Learning)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course where professionals enhance language application skills (text analysis, writing, communication) through simulation models reflecting real work environments. Features customized learning environments using personal devices (BYOD) and feedback-driven improvements in expressive/reading skills, with emphasis on professionalism through context-appropriate vocabulary usage and grammatical structure analysis.",
    "institution_type": "Corporate/Enterprise",
    "learner_age": "In their 30s",
    "learner_education": "High school",
    "learner_role": "Office worker (administrative/management)",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners complete language practical tasks (e.g., customer response text analysis, business report writing) with over 85% accuracy on a simulation-based digital platform, demonstrating professional communication skills through optimized vocabulary selection and grammatical structures.",
    "Learners demonstrate a 30%+ improvement in language task processing speed (e.g., document comprehension, email response generation) via pre-post test comparisons and show balanced development in reading comprehension and expressive abilities.",
    "Within a 5-day PBL project period, learners analyze two simulation models based on real-world scenarios (e.g., vocabulary selection strategies for handling customer inquiries, project schedule management reporting), and through team collaboration, submit a 3-page proposal including grammar, vocabulary, and expression optimization plans. They achieve 'Excellent' or higher in at least four of five evaluation rubric criteria: accuracy, creativity, practicality, collaboration, and completeness."
