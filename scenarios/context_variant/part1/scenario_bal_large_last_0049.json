    "Propose at least three design frameworks incorporating socioscientific analyses (organization, institutions, relationships) for applying a flipped learning-based blended model to business administration education.",
    "During the mid-term graduate course (2–4 weeks), learners create an integrated design map linking online pre-learning materials (videos, readings) with offline activities (discussions, workshops) and present three specific strategies aligned with business education goals (leadership, decision-making, resource management). These strategies must achieve an 80%+ suitability score via peer evaluation.",
    "Design at least two formative assessments that promote learner engagement through interactive elements (feedback, collaboration, critical thinking)."
