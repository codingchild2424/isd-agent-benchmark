The report must achieve ≥B+ grade (≥3/4 points) in ≥2 of 3 rubric criteria: clarity (structured logic flow), logicality (causal relationships between concepts), and evidence (textbook/case citations).",
    "Learners diagnose three limitations of the currently used textbook materials based on formative assessment results (item-wise accuracy rates, incorrect answer type analysis) and propose at least two specific improvement strategies for each limitation (e.g., additional case presentations, enhanced terminology explanations, strengthened visual materials), ensuring validity with a peer evaluation average of 4.0 or higher on a 5-point scale."
