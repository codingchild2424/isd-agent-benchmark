  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can design PBL projects in a 3D gamified environment to operate human resource development training programs that enhance mathematical problem-solving skills in spatial geometry, probability, and statistics.",
    "Using 3D sandbox tools similar to Creativerse, learners can implement math-based educational scenarios such as polygonal volume calculations, probability distribution simulations, and statistical graph visualizations.",
    "By analyzing learning outcome metrics (PE, EE, SI, FC), learners can improve educational satisfaction by 20% or more and demonstrate instructional effectiveness based on data on math concept application."
