    "Learners enhance learning motivation by more than 20% through scientific inquiry activities in web-based learning environments",
    "Over a two-week mid-term course, learners solve two challenging tasks weekly (e.g., algorithm optimization problems), engage in three or more curiosity-driven discussions (e.g., emerging technology trend analyses), and participate twice weekly in interactive peer learning activities (e.g., pair programming sessions), creating and executing self-directed learning plans.",
    "Within four weeks, learners complete one software prototype applying scientific concepts (e.g., physics laws, data analysis) and earn an average creative problem-solving score of 4/5 or higher from a corporate practitioner evaluation panel."
