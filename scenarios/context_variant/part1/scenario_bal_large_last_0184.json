    "Quantitatively compare differences in psychomotor performance and language information processing (lexical recall, sentence construction, grammatical structure analysis) between drug-influenced and non-influenced states.",
    "Learners apply state-dependent learning design principles (e.g., scheduling language learning materials according to medication timing) to create an experimental design measuring learning effectiveness under drug influence (vocabulary memorization accuracy, grammatical structure recall speed, text analysis efficiency) and derive results meeting ≥3 evaluation criteria (e.g., ≥80% vocabulary accuracy, ≥20% improvement in grammatical recall speed, ≥15% enhancement in text analysis accuracy).",
    "Over a 6-month course, learners produce project reports applying language learning strategies (2 text analysis methods: semantic structure/pragmatic analysis; 2 expression optimization methods: lexical selection/sentence structure adjustment) under 3 drug conditions (e.g., ADHD medication, antidepressants, sedatives) and achieve ≥3.5 average scores on peer/teacher evaluations (5-point scale)."
