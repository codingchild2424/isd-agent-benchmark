    "Improved language proficiency reflecting intercultural understanding in XR environments.",
    "Development of adaptive capacity to receive personalized language feedback through interaction with AI-based conversational agents.",
    "Through 4-week small-group collaborative activities, learners design three language teaching strategies applicable to real classroom situations (e.g., grammar explanations, role-play lessons) and receive peer feedback averaging ≥4 points on a 5-point rubric"
