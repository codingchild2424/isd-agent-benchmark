  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic language proficiency (grammar, vocabulary, communication fundamentals), basic digital device skills, experience in text comprehension and writing, and foundational awareness of diverse cultural contexts",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",

    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",

  "learning_goals": [
    "In blended learning environments, learners independently plan self-directed study ≥3 times weekly using online resources/tools (language apps, digital texts), setting vocabulary expansion and grammatical structure goals (verb conjugation, complex sentence construction, etc.)",
    "Learners participate in ≥3 real-time online discussions (20 minutes/session) weekly, providing specific feedback meeting ≥4 of 5 peer evaluation criteria (grammatical accuracy, pronunciation clarity, expression diversity, text structure consistency, cultural appropriateness)",
    "Through project-based assessments (e.g., portfolio creation), learners systematically document self-reflection and learning outcomes (reading comprehension improvement, writing skill development, vocabulary utilization increase, etc.) and visualize text analysis results in graphical formats (graphs, tables)"
