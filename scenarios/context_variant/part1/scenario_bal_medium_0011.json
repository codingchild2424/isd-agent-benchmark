    "After pre-learning experimental procedure videos and materials, achieve ≥80% proficiency in variable control and data collection/interpretation skills in the lab.",
    "Improve experimental error analysis and scientific evidence-based report writing through peer discussions and formative assessments.",
    "In a flipped learning environment, learners form teams of 3–4 members and: (1) analyze two provided videos and one reading to draft an experimental design document (including 1 research question, 2 hypotheses, and a 3-step experimental method specifying independent/dependent/controlled variables), (2) negotiate role assignments (leader, data collector, analyst, presenter), conduct the experiment within two weeks, and collect ≥10 qualitative/quantitative data points, (3) achieve ≥4/5 in peer evaluation (teamwork) and ≥8/10 in instructor evaluation (experimental design rubric), totaling ≥12/15 points."
