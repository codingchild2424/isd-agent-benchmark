  "learning_goals": [
    "Cultivate ethical decision-making and leadership strategy development by applying scientific observation, variable control, and hypothesis verification processes in politically complex organizational environments.",
    "In 4-member action learning teams, learners derive two real-world change tasks for science-related public organizations using scientific inquiry methods (brainstorming, SWOT analysis, experimental design), and submit an evidence-based report meeting institutional criteria (80% task clarity, 75% feasibility, 85% budget appropriateness) with a 12-week action plan (goals, timeline, budget, roles).",
    "Within a six-month course, learners complete ≥3 team collaboration scenarios using simulation tools (Miro, MURAL), achieve ≥80% on the Psychological Safety Index (PSI) survey, and submit an analysis report meeting ≥4 out of 5 conflict management checklist criteria."
