    "Learners can rapidly assess patient conditions with over 80% accuracy through medical emergency game scenarios.",
    "With adaptive scaffolding support in-game, learners can explain systematic decision-making procedures in complex emergency situations in three or more steps.",
    "At the end of the 6-month course, learners achieve a knowledge retention rate of 75% or higher between real-time simulated assessments at 2 and 12 weeks."
