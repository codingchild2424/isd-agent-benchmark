    "Learners construct a social issue analysis framework (e.g., climate change policy conflicts) by connecting three or more core concepts from economics, politics, and the environment.

Within two weeks, they submit a project plan (role definitions, communication protocols, risk management) tailored to real workplace scenarios (e.g., hospitals/construction sites).",
