  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic language skills (reading, writing, speaking, listening) and foundational understanding of collaborative learning. Possession of basic knowledge of grammatical structures and vocabulary expansion. Elementary comprehension of text structure analysis and writing strategies",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Collaborative learning in offline environments using digital devices (tablets/laptops). Students form 4–5 person teams for language projects, with instructors designing/supporting activities based on collaboration flow patterns and scripts. Project themes focus on language proficiency enhancement (multicultural text analysis, creative writing, presentation materials). Real-time feedback and peer evaluations using digital tools are emphasized, with comprehensive assessment of reading comprehension, expression, and grammar application.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will apply the 4-stage Collaborative Learning Flow Pattern (CLFP: Plan-Analyze-Develop-Evaluate) to design team-based language projects (multicultural content production). Specifically, they will: ① submit a project plan (3+ pages), ② produce an implementation report (5+ pages) including text structure analysis (3 types) and vocabulary selection strategies (5+ strategies), and ③ achieve a team average ≥4.0 in peer evaluation (5-point scale) and ≥4.2 in instructor evaluation (5-point scale), thereby enhancing reading comprehension and expressive skills.",
    "Learners will use a collaborative script template to create a 3-person role assignment plan (3 items: roles, responsibilities, timeline), produce a team project report (2,000 characters) applying a 3-step communication protocol (Preparation-Execution-Review), and integrate findings into a 15-minute presentation (10 slides). Presentations will be evaluated on grammatical accuracy (≥90%) and expressive diversity (5+ expressions), strengthening writing and presentation competencies.",
    "Learners will collaborate with ≥5 team members using digital tools (Google Docs, Notion) to complete language tasks (writing/presentation materials) on time. Through a real-time feedback system (e.g., Peergrade) with ≥3 revision cycles, they will achieve ≥80% linguistic completeness (grammar, vocabulary, logical coherence) in final outputs, improving vocabulary expansion and grammatical application."
