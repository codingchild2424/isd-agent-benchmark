    "prior_knowledge": "Possession of basic theoretical and practical experience in architecture/engineering/construction fields, foundational understanding of socio-technical systems (e.g., urban planning, public policy), basic knowledge of community conflict management and civic participation processes",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Establishing a hands-on learning environment using digital devices (tablets, laptops, etc.), this course involves team-based collaborative learning based on real project cases. To strengthen social domain competencies, it includes analysis of historical urban development cases (e.g., redevelopment projects) and local community conflict management examples. The learning process incorporates citizen participation workshops and stakeholder interview simulations to reflect community needs.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners perform 3D modeling and data management for construction projects using BIM software (Revit, ArchiCAD) and submit reports/presentations analyzing ≥3 decision-making scenarios considering economic factors (cost reduction ≥10%) and political factors (100% regulatory compliance). Additionally, they propose design solutions reflecting cultural/geographical contexts through community stakeholder analysis",
    "Using PBL (Problem-Based Learning), learners select three socio-technical issues from real construction projects (bridge design or infrastructure expansion), form 4-person teams, and complete the following collaborative process within 8 weeks: 1) Submit problem definition (Week 2), 2) Develop solution report (Week 4), 3) Submit prototype and conduct feedback session (Week 6), 4) Submit final report (15–20 pages, including community impact assessment and stakeholder analysis) and 10-minute presentation (Week 8). All outputs must achieve ≥4/5 points in three of four corporate evaluation rubric criteria (clarity, feasibility, innovation, impact). Reports must include citizen engagement plans and conflict management strategies",
    "Learners analyze three collaboration scenarios across design-construction-maintenance phases using BIM tools and write project reports meeting ≥8/10 BIM-based communication checklist items. Reports propose citizen engagement plans and community rights assurance strategies reflecting cultural/geographical contexts of construction projects, referencing historical urban development cases (e.g., redevelopment projects)"
