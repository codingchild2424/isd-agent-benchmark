  "title": "Generative AI-Utilized Language Education Instructional Design Workshop: Scientific Approach to Enhancing Text, Vocabulary, and Expressiveness",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Elementary instructional design knowledge, basic understanding of generative AI concepts, foundational grasp of core language education elements (grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, writing), and the ability to analyze texts and comprehend linguistic fundamentals (variables, evidence, conclusions)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Enhances competency in utilizing generative AI tools for designing language education courses for working professionals. Special emphasis is placed on business communication (speaking/writing) and acquiring specialized terminology. The course focuses on methods for evaluating the linguistic quality of AI-generated content and expression strategies applicable to real work environments.",
    "institution_type": "Graduate school",
    "learner_age": "In their 20s",
    "learner_education": "University",
    "learner_role": "Pre-service/In-service teacher",
    "domain_expertise": "Beginner"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can apply the SWOT analysis framework to evaluate the applicability of generative AI (ChatGPT, Gemini) in language education (grammar, vocabulary, writing, reading) across four categories, provide ≥1 concrete example per category (≥4 total), and submit a 500±50-word report (excluding cover, table of contents, references) within a week. The analysis must incorporate scientific inquiry methods (observation, hypothesis formulation, evidence collection) to assess the linguistic validity of AI-generated content.",
    "Learners can design a 3-stage (goal setting–content structuring–assessment design) language education course map using generative AI tools like ChatGPT, refine it based on peer reviews (≥3 peers) and instructor feedback (≥2 rounds), and achieve ≥80% proficiency in 4 out of 5 rubric criteria. The course map must emphasize text-based activities (reading, writing) and expressive strategies, with AI-driven approaches for vocabulary acquisition and grammar accuracy enhancement.",
    "Learners can verify the reliability (grammatical accuracy, lexical appropriateness, contextual coherence) of generative AI-produced language content, identify linguistic flaws, and propose context-specific revisions. This process applies critical thinking and linguistic analysis skills."
