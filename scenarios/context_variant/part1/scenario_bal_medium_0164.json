  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic medical knowledge, understanding of primary care procedures, foundational scientific methodology (experimental design, data analysis, hypothesis testing), experience with clinical observation and measurement tools",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Project-based learning with digital tools, emphasizing integration of trans-health knowledge into existing medical systems. Applies scientific inquiry methods (hypothesis formulation, measurement tools, analysis interpretation) and highlights evidence-based approaches for systematically observing/analyzing patient data to derive conclusions",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Enhancing the ability to develop scientific treatment plans reflecting physiological and psychological characteristics of transgender and non-binary patients—designing personalized treatment protocols through variable analysis.",
    "By the end of the one-week course, learners can propose solutions with over 80% accuracy in three transgender patient care scenarios by applying transgender health knowledge (gender confirmation procedures, hormone therapy considerations, etc.) to existing protocols. This process includes variable control, evidence-based analysis, and data collection/interpretation based on experimental design principles.",
    "Acquiring communication skills to respect the rights of transgender patients in multicultural settings and cultivating patient-centered approaches based on scientific observation—enhancing cultural sensitivity through clinical evidence analysis."
