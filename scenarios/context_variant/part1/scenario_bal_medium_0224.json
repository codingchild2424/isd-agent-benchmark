    "In a 4-week project-based simulation environment, learners will collaborate with 3–5 team members to establish three shared goals and create a 1-page document specifying cognitive and social capital contribution levels (1–5 scale) for each goal.",
    "Learners apply at least three language strategies to build trust relationships (relational social capital) in VR-based collaborative tools",
    "Over 2–4 weeks, learners will achieve two outcomes in team project deliverables: 1) develop and document at least three new language expressions, and 2) write one report applying an existing language system (e.g., company-standard glossary). Each outcome must pass peer evaluation (5-point scale, average ≥4.0) and instructor verification (≥80% threshold)."
