  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can simulate the planning-execution-evaluation process of IMC strategies in a virtual environment with over 85% accuracy using real brand cases, while developing text mining and linguistic pattern analysis skills for target audience analysis. This includes strategy formulation using vocabulary extraction and sentiment analysis from consumer reviews.",
    "In team-based VR projects, five core competencies (e.g., leadership, creative planning, digital channel management) can be measured via learner competency assessment tables. Additionally, learners can develop a language style guide for brand message consistency, strengthening skills in applying grammar structures and specialized terminology aligned with brand tone and manner.",
    "Learners can collaborate with local community clients (e.g., welfare centers, neighborhood communities) to execute an IMC campaign within three months, deriving quantitative data such as participant survey responses (70%+ response rate) and campaign goal achievement rates (80%+). They can also enhance professional terminology usage and persuasive language skills for campaign reports, applying writing and reading strategies that reflect cultural contexts."
