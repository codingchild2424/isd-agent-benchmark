    "Improve communication skills (speaking, listening, expression) in specialized fields (medical/business, etc.) by over 80% through role-playing based on virtual scenarios.",
    "Increase language learning engagement and motivation by 30% using a gamification reward system (badges, leaderboards, etc.).",
    "Learners form a team of 3 peers, perform a 15-minute role-play according to a given practical scenario (e.g., customer response, project meeting), and achieve a 'B' (80+ points) rating in 4 out of 5 evaluation rubric items (communication clarity, task terminology appropriateness, collaboration attitude, pronunciation accuracy, vocabulary diversity).",
    "Learners analyze VR simulation log data (minimum 3 sessions) to create a visualized report (graphs/tables) on their professional language usage patterns (10+ vocabulary choices, 5 sentence structures, average response speed) and submit an improvement plan incorporating instructor feedback."
