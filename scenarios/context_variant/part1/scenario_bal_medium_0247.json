  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic mathematics education theories (fraction operations, geometric proofs, etc.), foundational instructional design knowledge, basic LaTeX or programming understanding, graph interpretation skills, and introductory problem-solving strategies",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Strengthens pre- and in-service teachers’ ability to design math teaching strategies applicable in digital environments. Focuses on formative assessments (problem-solving, graph interpretation) and digital tools (GeoGebra, Desmos), including case studies on fraction operations and geometric proofs.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Design three or more electronic instructional strategies (scaffolding, collaborative learning, problem-solving models) suitable for math concepts (fraction operations, geometric proofs, etc.) using machine-readable languages (e.g., LaTeX).",
    "Learners apply three content-neutral instructional strategies (scaffolding, collaborative learning, problem-solving models) to math education cases (fraction operations, geometric proofs, etc.) and propose at least two improvement plans per strategy through peer feedback and rubric evaluations (clarity, feasibility, effectiveness).",
    "Learners design formative assessments (5+ quiz items + 1 graph analysis activity) at middle school grade 1 level using H5P or GeoGebra and develop/evaluate math teaching strategies achieving ≥4 points (5-point scale) in two of three peer assessment rubric categories (content relevance, technical implementation, educational effectiveness)."
