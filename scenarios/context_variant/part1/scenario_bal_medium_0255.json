    "Learners apply three or more online language-learning strategies (text summarization, audio recording, image association, hands-on practice) aligned with their learning style and achieve 80% or higher comprehension of the material.",
    "Based on a one-week language usage journal (three cases per medical/nursing scenario) and learning style diagnostic results, learners can submit a personalized learning plan incorporating three or more customized strategies (e.g., visual aids, peer feedback integration)."
