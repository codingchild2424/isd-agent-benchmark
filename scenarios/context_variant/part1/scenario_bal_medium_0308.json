  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic experience with digital tools, foundational knowledge of early childhood education, understanding of language development stages in young children (vocabulary acquisition, sentence construction, communication skills)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Smartphone-based microlearning implementation for corporate education managers/leaders. Aims to acquire language learning strategies integrating computational thinking and robotics (storytelling robots, conversational coding) in early childhood education. Focuses on improving learners’ expressive skills (sentence construction), vocabulary (new word acquisition), and reading comprehension",
    "institution_type": "Corporate/Enterprise",
    "learner_age": "40s and above",
    "learner_education": "Middle school",
    "learner_role": "Office worker (administrative/management)",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will apply the four core elements of computational thinking (decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, algorithms) to early childhood language education activities (storytelling, vocabulary categorization, sentence structure analysis) via a MOOC platform.",
    "Robotics programming tools accessible via smartphones (e.g., block coding) can be utilized to design language learning robotics practice scenarios for young children, such as word card sorting, sentence construction, and dialogue simulation.",
    "Learners can achieve a satisfaction score of 4.0/5.0 or higher in a post-course educational effectiveness survey by applying interaction strategies on a MOOC platform: learner-instructor (2 real-time Q&A sessions), learner-content (3 weekly content feedback submissions), and learner-learner (1 discussion forum moderation). Language education effectiveness is evaluated through vocabulary expansion, expressive enhancement, and reading comprehension improvement."
