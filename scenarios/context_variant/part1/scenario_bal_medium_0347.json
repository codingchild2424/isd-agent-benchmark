    "Participants explain 3 recent scientific research trends (hypothesis formulation, variable control, data analysis methods) according to scientific inquiry procedures through webinar participation",
    "Participants utilize ≥90% of real-time interaction features (chat, polls) on mobile devices during webinars and effectively articulate questions arising from scientific inquiry processes from experimental/observational/measurable perspectives",
    "Participants submit a project-based evaluation report within 1 week, describing in ~500 characters how they applied 3+ hypotheses, 2 evidence collection methods, and 1 conclusion derived from the webinar to a real-world case (e.g., quality management process improvement). They achieve \"met\" ratings in ≥4 out of 5 rubric criteria"
