Using hyperlinks, they will connect at least two related documents (e.g., climate change, smart cities) and submit a final output by the end of the 6-month course that meets four or more of five digital citizenship criteria: accuracy, collaboration, creativity, connectivity, and social impact.",
    "Learners will construct three or more mathematical models (linear/nonlinear regression, optimization models, etc.) using spatial information (coordinates, area, resource distribution) collected during collaborative mapping. Based on these models, they will propose sustainability solutions, such as improving energy efficiency by 15% or reducing waste by 20%."
