  "title": "Integrating Meaning and Sensibility in Mathematics Education: Ontosemiotic Approach-Based Design for Enhanced Mathematical Representation and Communication",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding basic mathematical concepts, foundational experience in educational settings, and basic comprehension of mathematical terminology and linguistic expressions (grammar/vocabulary)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "For in-service educators, this program strengthens lesson design competencies using onto-semiotic approaches to understand meaning-making processes in math education. Focuses on linguistic expression (reading/writing) and interpretation of mathematical concepts, and facilitating peer mathematical communication (listening/speaking).",
    "institution_type": "Public/Non-profit educational institution",
    "learner_age": "In their 30s",
    "learner_education": "High school",
    "learner_role": "Pre-service/In-service teacher",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Apply the core concepts of onto-semiotic approaches (object, sign, meaning) to mathematics education and develop the ability to connect mathematical and linguistic expressions (reading/writing).",
    "Integrate and analyze symbols, contexts, and cognitive elements to form the meaning of mathematical concepts and cultivate the ability to convert them into linguistic expressions (writing/interpretation).",
    "Learners design three mobile-optimized microlearning activities and develop educational materials achieving over 4/5 (5-point scale) in meaning-construction satisfaction and over 3.5/5 in mathematical communication (listening/speaking) improvement in learner feedback surveys."
