  "title": "Short-Intensive Online Language Learning Management Competency Enhancement Course: Integrated Design for Text Analysis, Expressive Skills, and Reading Comprehension Strategies",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic experience with digital learning tools and primary/secondary language proficiency (basic grammar, core vocabulary, simple text comprehension). Additionally, exposure to diverse text types (expository, argumentative, narrative)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Most learners are students interested in or preparing for employment in language education. Requires balancing real-time interaction (speaking/listening) and self-directed learning (reading/writing) in personal tablet/laptop environments. Emphasizes immediately applicable language instruction design competencies. Specifically cultivates abilities to select culturally contextualized texts and develop expression strategies when designing classes for multicultural learners.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Use an LMS to plan/adjust personalized language learning paths incorporating vocabulary expansion and grammatical analysis, applying differentiated reading strategies by text genre.",
    "Learners conduct ≥3 feedback-driven language practice activities (role-plays, discussions) with two peers using real-time collaboration tools (Zoom Breakout Rooms, Jamboard), submit deliverables meeting ≥4 of five feedback checklist items (pronunciation, fluency, grammar, vocabulary, logical structure), and apply communication-function-specific strategies (explanation, persuasion, negotiation).",
    "By analyzing formative assessment data (quizzes, writing evaluations, participation rates), learners can improve instructional strategies based on reading comprehension and expressive skills. Specifically, grammar and vocabulary supplementation strategies are proposed through error pattern analysis."
