    "Acquiring the ability to design a system that certifies the information identification-selection-utilization process in stages through digital badges",
    "Learners select 3 real development problems (1 algorithm optimization, 2 data analyses) during a 6-month course, design decision-making processes based on information literacy (data collection/analysis/visualization), submit project deliverables (reports/code/demo videos), and achieve 80+ points (out of 100) in the evaluation rubric (problem definition clarity: 25 points, data utilization: 35 points, solution effectiveness: 40 points)."
