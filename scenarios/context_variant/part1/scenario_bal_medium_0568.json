  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic maritime safety terminology, computer and internet proficiency, foundational knowledge of social relationships and collaborative processes, basic concepts of civic rights and community systems",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Customized curriculum for systematically acquiring practical competencies required in hazardous environments and citizen-participatory safety culture. Emphasizes institutional improvements for marine accident prevention (policies, laws, economic incentives) and community collaboration strategies (reflecting cultural characteristics, analyzing historical cases, considering geographical conditions). Role-playing activities among learners simulate political interest coordination.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can analyze 3 uncertainty cases in marine work environments (e.g., ship collision avoidance, marine structure safety assessment) using fuzzy set theory, simulate fuzzy logic-based modeling with ≥80% accuracy, and propose reports for improving marine safety policies, including strategies to strengthen civil rights and community safety systems.",
    "By integrating axiomatic design methodology with a socio-technical systems approach, learners can systematically derive functional requirements and stakeholder (government, corporations, civic groups) collaboration frameworks for marine safety protocols, particularly establishing multi-stakeholder coordination strategies considering cultural differences.",
    "Through virtual simulations, learners can perform decision-making processes during marine emergencies with ≥90% accuracy, propose citizen engagement and community collaboration plans (e.g., volunteer networks, community-based monitoring systems) for crisis management, and include geographical characteristic reflection plans based on historical cases."
