  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners critically evaluate the logical structure and vocabulary usage of texts by applying at least three dialectical analysis frameworks (e.g., thesis-antithesis-synthesis model) to language-related topics.",
    "Through a discussion platform, learners generate and share at least one logical counterargument (e.g., counterexamples, assumption critiques, alternative proposals) to peers’ claims, enhancing argumentative writing and oral expression skills.",
    "By comparing three formal documents and three negotiation dialogues, learners derive at least two practical communication strategies (e.g., persuasive phrasing, context-specific vocabulary) aligned with an analytical framework (context, purpose, audience proficiency) and write 150-character application plans per case."
