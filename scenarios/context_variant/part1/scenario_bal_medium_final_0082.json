  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic knowledge of speech-language pathology and special education, over three years of special education field experience, experience in language assessment and intervention for students with disabilities, and VR technology-based educational tool development experience",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Simulation/VR-based",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Focuses on developing customized language learning solutions using low-cost VR technology on smartphones. Highlights differentiated support for disabilities (text: subtitles/Braille conversion; audio: speed adjustment/speech synthesis; visual: 3D modeling/color contrast) and applies UDL (Universal Design for Learning) principles.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Design an assessment framework in a virtual reality environment that considers the language development stages (listening, speaking, reading, writing) of students with disabilities, and develop a comprehensive diagnostic tool through text, speech, and visual expression analysis.",
    "Develop three or more adaptive language teaching materials, including vocabulary expansion (categorized by semantic fields), grammar training (visualization of sentence structures), and communication simulations (context-based role-playing) using smartphone-compatible VR tools.",
    "Implement a VR learning scenario based on Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles and apply standardized pre- and post-assessment procedures to verify effectiveness in improving language skills (pronunciation, grammar, reading comprehension, and expressive abilities)."
