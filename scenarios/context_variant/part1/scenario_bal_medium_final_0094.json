  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can visually explain the spatial relationships of major organ systems using 3D virtual dissection tools",
    "Learners can analyze anatomical structures using annotation features provided by digital platforms and label them with over 80% accuracy",
    "Learners can pass quizzes related to human anatomy with over 70% accuracy using in-platform assessment tools"
