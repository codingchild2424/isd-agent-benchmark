  "title": "VR-Based Ecological Dynamics Theory-Enhanced Language Communication Program for Improving Sports Performance",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic sports science knowledge, VR technology experience, and fundamental communication skills in sports contexts (listening, speaking, feedback provision) alongside basic grammar and vocabulary application abilities",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A program integrating customized sports training environments with digital devices, ecological dynamics theory for real-time decision-making enhancement, and team-based language communication training. Learners are evaluated on linguistic analysis (text interpretation, logical explanation), expression (persuasive presentation), and collaboration (role allocation) in response to unpredictable situations in virtual environments.",

    "learner_age": "Teens (13-19)",

    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can design personalized training scenarios using VR systems and perform strategic communication (speaking, listening, feedback) with team members.",
    "Based on ecological dynamics theory, learners enhance their ability to explain real-time decision-making processes in response to environmental changes through both verbal (critical explanation, argumentation) and nonverbal expressions (gestures, facial expressions).",
    "In virtual environment platforms (Minecraft Education Edition, VR language games, etc.), learners perform creative problem-solving scenarios (e.g., virtual maze escape, language puzzle solving) at least twice monthly, share structured verbal feedback of three or more sentences (e.g., \"I solved the problem by utilizing spatial awareness strategies\") with team members, and achieve an average score of 4 or higher on a 5-point scale during peer evaluations."
