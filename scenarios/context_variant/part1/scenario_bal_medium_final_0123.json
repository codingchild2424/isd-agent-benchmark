    "In large-scale vocational training (≥50 learners), learners select 3 mobile-accessible assessment strategies (quizzes, real-time polls, collaborative tasks) via smartphones/tablets, implement them on an LMS, and ensure ≥80% of learners complete the first attempt smoothly. Each strategy must meet technical stability (no lag), usability (intuitive UI), and validity (alignment with learning objectives).",
    "Completing ≥3 project-based assessments in a 6-month course, learners propose ≥2 actionable instructional design improvements applicable to real vocational settings (e.g., industrial field training, mock lesson design) and achieve an average ≥4 points in expert panel evaluations (5-point scale)."
