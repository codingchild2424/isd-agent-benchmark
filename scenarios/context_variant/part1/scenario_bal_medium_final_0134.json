  "title": "TPACK-Based Language·Content Integration Technology Competency Development Intensive Course for Science Teachers",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Knowledge of secondary science curriculum content, basic proficiency in digital tools, and foundational understanding of scientific terminology/text interpretation (including lexical analysis and contextual reading skills)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Targeting corporate science education instructors, this program aims to strengthen TPACK model application capabilities in smartphone-based blended learning environments. Focuses on developing teaching strategies for linguistic accuracy of scientific concepts (terminology definitions, sentence structures) and effective delivery (multimodal expression, interaction design).",
    "institution_type": "Corporate/Enterprise",
    "learner_age": "In their 20s",
    "learner_education": "Middle school",
    "learner_role": "Professional (medical/legal/technical)",
    "domain_expertise": "Beginner"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "When designing science lessons, integrate technology with linguistic expression strategies (text structuring, vocabulary selection, explanatory frameworks) using the seven knowledge domains of the TPACK framework.",
    "Develop three or more learning management, assessment, and communication strategies using smartphone-based tools (e.g., Canva, Quizlet), including methods for defining, categorizing, and applying scientific terminology, as well as text-based interaction (reading/writing feedback).",
    "Within one week, learners create a digital literacy self-assessment checklist (5 items), establish a technology-integrated lesson plan (3 activities), and draft a sample lesson plan incorporating three clear linguistic strategies for explaining scientific concepts: analogical explanations, stepwise decomposition, and visual-textual linkage."
