  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic digital tool usage experience, understanding of foundational educational concepts, and secondary-level or higher language proficiency (grammar, vocabulary, reading, listening, speaking)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A process focused on enhancing learners' linguistic expressive skills (speaking/writing) and comprehension (listening/reading/reading comprehension) simultaneously by leveraging the interactive affordances of digital learning materials in smartphone-centric constrained technological environments. Particularly emphasizes activity design centered on context-based vocabulary acquisition and internalization of grammatical structures.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can design three or more integrated language learning activities (reading, writing, listening) that reflect digital media characteristics (hypertext, multimedia).",
    "Learners can analyze three or more educational affordances (e.g., touch interaction, push notifications, multimedia integration) in smartphone-based learning environments (apps/webs) and design a learning material plan incorporating over 10 vocabulary/grammar items (e.g., complex sentence structures, idiomatic expressions) according to evaluation criteria (clarity, feasibility, educational effectiveness).",
    "Learners can execute effectiveness verification procedures for three digital language learning materials using formative assessment tools (e.g., Google Forms, Kahoot!) and compile a report including pre-post test score comparisons and learner satisfaction surveys (5-point scale, average over 4 points, response rate over 80%)."
