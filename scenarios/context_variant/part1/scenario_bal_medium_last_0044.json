  "title": "Workshop on VR-Based Scientific Inquiry Learning Environment Design and Facilitation Strategies: Integrated Approach to Experiments, Hypotheses, and Variable Control",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic VR technology understanding, intermediate science expertise (experimental design, variable control, data analysis, scientific evidence interpretation), and foundational grasp of the scientific inquiry process (observation, hypothesis formulation, experimentation, conclusion)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Strengthening competencies in creating and applying VR-based science education content—focusing on integrating the scientific inquiry process (observation, hypothesis formation, experimentation, conclusion-drawing) into VR environments. Learners experience variable control in virtual labs, analyze measurement data, and derive conclusions based on scientific evidence.",
    "institution_type": "Vocational training institution",
    "learner_age": "40s and above",
    "learner_education": "High school",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can enhance knowledge acquisition of scientific concepts (e.g., chemical reaction mechanisms, physics laws) by over 20% by combining VR animations and auditory texts in an optimized sequence.",
    "Learners can derive work process improvements using three in-depth questioning strategies (e.g., \"Why is this step necessary?\", \"Are there alternative methods?\", \"What problems might occur during actual work?\") in VR-based industrial simulations and achieve an \"excellent\" rating in at least four out of five rubric categories (clarity, practicality, creativity, scientific validity, experimental design suitability), with a focus on variable control and evidence-based conclusions.",
    "Learners can propose at least three VR-text integration strategies according to sequence design principles and scientific inquiry procedures (observation → hypothesis setting → experiment design → data analysis → conclusion)."
