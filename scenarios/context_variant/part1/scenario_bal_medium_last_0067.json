    "Learners understand statistics and data science pedagogy at the secondary education level and can effectively achieve learning objectives on online platforms using self-regulated learning strategies.",
    "Learners will design one statistical educational material within the intermediate course (4 weeks), develop three visualization outputs using Python’s Matplotlib/Seaborn, and one data analysis process applying Pandas/TensorFlow, achieving over 80% attainment in peer evaluation and instructor feedback.",
    "Learners optimize their learning experiences by utilizing personalized tools (e.g., progress tracking, customized recommendations) on online platforms and propose strategies to apply these to secondary classroom settings."
