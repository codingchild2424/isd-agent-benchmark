  "title": "Language-Based Text Analysis Project for Developing Scientific Reasoning Assessment Tools",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic scientific methodologies and psychometric assessment concepts, reading/writing skills for scientific texts, experience with academic vocabulary, and foundational grasp of linguistic analysis techniques",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course emphasizing convergent approaches through language domain application, aiming to develop scientific thinking assessment tools needed in the Fourth Industrial Revolution era. It particularly focuses on linguistic expression of scientific concepts (text analysis, logical structuring, term appropriateness) and the educational applicability of assessment tools. Learners acquire methods to systematically evaluate linguistic characteristics of scientific reasoning using language-based analysis techniques.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can analyze the three core components of scientific reasoning (question formulation, hypothesis generation, experimental design) from a linguistic perspective, derive two or more evaluation items per component (e.g., hypothesis clarity, logical consistency of experimental design), and create a systematized evaluation matrix.",
    "Develop a draft scientific reasoning assessment tool that meets psychometric criteria (reliability, validity) and reflects linguistic accuracy (grammar, vocabulary use, text structuring).",
    "Learners can design one applicable evaluation framework for real educational settings (elementary or middle school) through PBL team projects (four-person teams), deliver simulation presentations achieving an average score of 4 or higher out of 5 on peer and instructor rubrics (five items), with linguistic expression of scientific concepts (text structuring, term appropriateness, logical organization) included in evaluation criteria."
