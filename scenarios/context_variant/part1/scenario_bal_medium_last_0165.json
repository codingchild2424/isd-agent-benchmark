    "Learners improve reading-writing-speaking scores by over 30% through language-linguistic intelligence reinforcement activities over four weeks, cultivating analytical skills that consider social relationships and cultural contexts in sociocultural texts (including historical, geographical, and economic materials)",
    "Learners independently perform and certify language reasoning activities (social context analysis, cultural implication inference, historical variable consideration, etc.) at least three times weekly via a mobile platform",
    "Learners interpret three complex sociocultural texts (historical events, economic phenomena, cultural comparisons, etc.) of over 500 words each using linguistic thinking tools (mind maps, keyword linking, etc.), submit 10+ keyword connections (social relationships, historical variables, political elements, etc.) and three-tier mind maps (integrating political-economic-cultural elements) per text, and achieve over 80% scores in peer and instructor evaluations (clarity, logic, social insight criteria)"
