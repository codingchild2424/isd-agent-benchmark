  "title": "[Self-Directed] Gamification-Based Programming Language Learning Design for Beginners: Strengthening Syntax Analysis and Error-Resolution Competencies",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic programming concepts and understanding of fundamental syntax structures in programming languages (variables, conditionals, loops). Foundational ability to write text-based code and perform syntax analysis",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Project-based learning environment for pre-service teachers to strengthen digital literacy. Incorporates gamification elements for motivation and foundational programming language competency development. Focuses on text-based coding and syntax analysis skills, with enhanced programming learning effects through linguistic approaches (grammatical structure/expression analysis).",
    "institution_type": "University (undergraduate)",
    "learner_age": "In their 30s",
    "learner_education": "Elementary",
    "learner_role": "Student",
    "domain_expertise": "Beginner"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can achieve an 80% or higher accuracy rate in programming problem-solving, analyze code structure and algorithmic expression methods, and systematically explain the syntactic framework of programming languages.",
    "Learners can apply a three-step self-reflective feedback process—(1) error cause analysis, (2) alternative learning strategy development, and (3) action plan documentation—with 80% or higher accuracy to programming language learning tasks (e.g., syntax error debugging, variable naming tests) where three or more consecutive errors occurred in gamified systems (e.g., Duolingo, Memrise), thereby improving the accuracy and logical flow of language expressions.",
    "Upon completing the six-month course, learners can compile a personalized problem-solving log analysis report, systematically categorize code-writing patterns and linguistic error types (e.g., syntactic errors, semantic errors), and propose improvement strategies."
