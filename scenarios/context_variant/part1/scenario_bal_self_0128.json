    "Within a 2-week project period, learners can (1) create a personalized vocabulary acquisition plan including 50 target words, (2) specify three learning methods, (3) maintain weekly learning logs (weekly vocabulary test ≥80%, daily usage frequency ≥10 records), and (4) submit final presentation materials (including execution analysis vs. plan) meeting at least four of five evaluation criteria (average ≥3.2/4.0 per item)."
