    "By the end of the 4-week course, learners can develop step-by-step implementation plans for two real vocational training scenarios using the three core components of the Immersive Learning Model (ILMU)—learning design, technology, and engagement—and demonstrate achievement of 80% or higher in at least four out of five expert evaluation rubric items.",
    "Learners can create one 360-degree video-based IVR (Immersive Virtual Reality) content using Unity or Unreal Engine in a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) environment, test-deploy it to 10+ users, and manage operations with fewer than two functional errors.",
    "Within the 4-week course, learners can design one IVR (Virtual Reality)-based science lesson model, document the project development process (requirements analysis, prototype creation, testing) in three stages, and deliver a presentation achieving 80% or higher satisfaction in peer evaluations and instructor feedback.",
    "Learners can establish three or more strategies to enhance learner engagement and interaction in vocational training institutions’ mid-term courses (2–4 weeks) using IVR (Immersive Virtual Reality) technology and create a checklist to evaluate the effectiveness of those strategies."
