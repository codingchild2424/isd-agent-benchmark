  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic digital literacy, foundational STEAM domain understanding, basic awareness of social structures and cultural diversity, and preliminary knowledge of civic rights and social responsibilities",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course supporting professionals in medical/legal/technical fields to design youth learning experiences in digital environments. It focuses on implementing choice-based learning activities in smartphone-centric limited-technology environments, emphasizing content that strengthens youth civic consciousness and social responsibility. Through community problem-solving projects considering historical/geographical contexts, it aims to simultaneously develop youth cultural identity and global citizenship.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners design digital learning modules based on constructivist principles, reflecting adolescents' social interactions and cultural diversity, and strengthening civic consciousness and awareness of rights.",
    "Over 1–6 months, learners design three or more choice-based learning pathways (e.g., AI basics, startup projects, K-culture exploration) based on survey results of adolescents' interests in technology, economy, and culture. They achieve over 80% satisfaction in peer and teacher evaluation rubrics and propose institutional approaches to solving local community issues.",
    "Using smartphone-based collaboration platforms (Google Workspace, Padlet, etc.), learners complete a 6-week project (addressing local issues) in teams of 3–5, submitting a digital portfolio reflecting civic engagement (surveys from ≥10 participants) and collaborative problem-solving processes (meeting minutes ≥5, role distribution evaluation). They assess project impact through social network analysis.",
    "Learners create learning scenarios integrating broad STEAM concepts, solving real-life problems linked to social contexts (environment, human rights, economic inequality, etc.), and deriving educational value connected to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."
