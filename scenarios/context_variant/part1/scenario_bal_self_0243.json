    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic statistical concepts (mean, variance, standard deviation) and fundamental principles of experimental design (observation, hypothesis formulation, variable control). Basic awareness of the scientific inquiry process (problem definition-hypothesis formulation-experimental design-data analysis-conclusion drawing)",

    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Mobile app-based learning modules in BYOD environments with real-time formative assessment. Provides virtual lab environments simulating the full data cycle (collection→measurement→analysis). Learners systematically experience scientific inquiry, reducing experimental anxiety and enhancing evidence-based conclusion skills",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will improve self-efficacy in statistical calculations and hypothesis testing by 20%, reducing anxiety related to experimental design through systematic practice in variable control and evidence-based conclusion drawing.",
    "Learners will set three statistical inquiry goals within a week following SMART principles (identifying independent/dependent variables, selecting measurement tools, establishing correlation analysis criteria), create a weekly study plan (including time allocation, experimental design methods, analysis criteria), and verify ≥80% execution via a checklist.",
    "Learners will improve accuracy in applying statistical concepts (sample selection, ANOVA, Pearson correlation coefficient calculation) by 35% through formative assessments."
