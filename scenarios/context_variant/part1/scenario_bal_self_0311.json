  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational psychology theories, basic understanding of clinical settings, grammar and vocabulary skills necessary for psychological counseling, and introductory knowledge of therapeutic communication techniques (reflective listening, empathetic responses, etc.)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Mobile-optimized content for smartphone-based learning, real-time case analysis, and decision-making training via VR simulations. Especially emphasizes contextual understanding of patient statements, therapeutic language expression training, and integrated practice of professional vocabulary and nonverbal communication required in clinical settings.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "In a VR simulation environment, learners observe clinical cases, analyze patient-therapist dialogue texts, and establish effective intervention strategies including therapeutic communication techniques (e.g., empathetic responses, reflective listening).",
    "Learners perform a 10-minute role-play applying three cognitive-behavioral therapy-based verbal expression techniques (open-ended questions, reframing, emotion reflection) using online collaboration tools (Zoom, Miro, etc.), and achieve ≥4/5 points on a peer evaluation rubric (communication effectiveness, technique accuracy, linguistic flexibility).",
    "By the end of a 1-week intensive course, learners identify key content in patient statements from three provided clinical case scenarios with 80% accuracy, and propose ≥2 appropriate nursing interventions (1 verbal + 1 behavioral) applying relevant clinical knowledge."
