  "title": "[Self-Directed] Mathematical Thinking Coaching Strategies for Enhancing Feedback Effectiveness in Pre-Service Mathematics Teachers: Focus on Proof, Variables, and Problem Solving",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic mathematics teaching methodologies and understanding of core mathematical concepts (equations, functions, geometry), mathematical proof and graph interpretation skills, and foundational teaching experience as a pre-service educator",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course strengthening the capacity to provide short-term mathematical feedback in mobile learning environments using digital devices. Designed for preservice teachers to effectively deliver coaching feedback—focusing on graphs, formulas, and problem-solving processes—regarding strategies that stimulate student thinking. It emphasizes mathematical analysis (measurement, comparison, reasoning) and evidence-based feedback construction.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Preservice teachers can explain concrete and actionable feedback methods by applying eliciting student thinking strategies to mathematical problem-solving processes (equations, geometry, functions).",
    "A proactive attitude toward engaging in professional development activities using mathematical proof and statistical analysis techniques is fostered to enhance the quality of coaching feedback.",
    "The ability to focus feedback on mathematical variables (variables, constants, conditions) and core instructional behaviors (problem presentation, solution process guidance) is evaluated through analysis of actual classroom videos."
