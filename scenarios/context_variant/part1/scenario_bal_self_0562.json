  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic instructional design and gamification concepts, foundational knowledge of the scientific inquiry process (experiment design, data analysis, variable control, hypothesis testing)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Mobile-optimized training for in-service practitioners, implementing smartphone-based microlearning in PC-unavailable environments. Emphasizes applicability in real-life contexts by integrating scientific problem-solving processes with game mechanics. Focuses on replicating scientific inquiry processes (observation/measuring/analysis/conclusion) through game elements.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will design an educational scenario incorporating gamification elements (XP, badges, leaderboards) that reflects the scientific inquiry process (hypothesis→experiment design→data measurement→evidence-based conclusion).",
    "Learners develop three or more microlearning gamification activities applicable in mobile environments (e.g., virtual experiments, simulations for manipulating independent/dependent variables, scientific argumentation quizzes).",
    "Learners establish three or more specific metrics (e.g., participation rate ≥80%, immersion ≥4/5-point scale, knowledge transfer ≥70% accuracy) to evaluate educational effectiveness (engagement, immersion, knowledge delivery) when designing gamification, and create a draft assessment rubric incorporating scientific thinking (systematic observation, logical reasoning, evidence utilization) evaluation criteria."
