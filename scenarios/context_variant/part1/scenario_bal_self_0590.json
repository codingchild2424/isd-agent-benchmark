    "Learners can measure cognitive load changes based on task difficulty in VR simulation environments using TEPRs (pupillary light reflex-corrected values).",
    "Learners must compare cognitive load data (e.g., NASA-TLX scores) and self-assessment results (5-point scale) collected during training, write an analysis report, and improve the training plan in ≥2 ways based on findings.",
    "Learners must analyze the correlation between performance metrics (task completion time, error rate) and cognitive load indicators (heart rate variability, survey scores) in VR-based simulations, propose ≥3 training strategy adjustments, and apply them to actual training scenarios."
