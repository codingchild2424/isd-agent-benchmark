  "title": "[Self-directed] Ontology-Based Search System Utilization for Enhancing Language Research Literature Processing Competencies",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic academic search skills, understanding of language research concepts, proficiency in basic grammar and text analysis, ability to decode academic terminology and identify discourse structures",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course designed to effectively process and integrate language research literature in a smartphone-based online environment. Includes activities for improving learners' reading comprehension, expressive skills, and critical thinking. Particularly emphasizes strengthening the ability to analyze academic texts, compare language theories, and synthesize research findings for presentation.",
    "institution_type": "Graduate school",
    "learner_age": "In their 20s",
    "learner_education": "High school",
    "learner_role": "Student",
    "domain_expertise": "Beginner"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners identify lexical and structural characteristics of core language research concepts (language constructs, discourse causality) with 85% accuracy using an ontology-based search system and interpret text analysis results.",
    "Learners visualize theoretical relationships among ≥3 core theories (e.g., functionalism, cognitivism, socioconstructivism) in language studies using concept-mapping tools (Miro, CmapTools, etc.). They design a draft research framework based on discourse analysis and text interpretation, incorporating peer and advisor feedback into a final report.",
    "The system reduces false-positive rates by 40% and improves language theory integration efficiency by 30% compared to conventional search systems, enhancing skills in reading, critical analysis, and academic expression of research literature."
