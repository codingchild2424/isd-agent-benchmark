  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic language proficiency (reading, writing, listening, speaking), practical experience in related fields, foundational business vocabulary and grammar comprehension, and basic awareness of multicultural environments",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A tailored learning environment strengthening practical competencies across diverse language scenarios (negotiation, presentations, conflict resolution). Focuses on comprehensively enhancing expressive skills, reading comprehension, and cultural understanding, particularly emphasizing communication proficiency through specialized terminology acquisition and cultural context analysis.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can communicate clearly and effectively in professional settings, using job-specific terminology and business vocabulary with 90% accuracy.",
    "In VR simulation environments, learners can perform three global business negotiation scenarios (e.g., price negotiation, contract terms, cultural conflict resolution). They must achieve 4/5+ on each criterion (communication clarity, cultural adaptability, strategic persuasiveness) on a 15-point rubric (total ≥12/15).",
    "Learners can apply cross-cultural communication strategies (e.g., high-/low-context communication, nonverbal interpretation, cultural context analysis) situationally, achieving an 80%+ success rate."
