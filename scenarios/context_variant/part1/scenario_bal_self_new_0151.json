  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Elementary mathematics pedagogy knowledge, understanding of core mathematical concepts (equations, statistics, probability), and graph interpretation skills",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Strengthens elementary school teachers' capacity to develop evaluation systems for measuring mathematics education effectiveness. Particularly emphasizes designing assessment tools for specific mathematical competencies: students' calculation skills, problem-solving processes (variable analysis), and graph interpretation. Stresses evidence-based approaches for achieving educational objectives.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Acquire the ability to design three or more scientific evaluation metrics (e.g., computational accuracy, problem-solving time, graph interpretation skills) to measure educational program effectiveness.",
    "Develop application plans for assessment frameworks tailored to educational levels (elementary school/lifelong learning) and analyze the utilization of formulas and statistical models (e.g., equations, statistical models).",
    "Execute two or more data collection methods for learning outcome analysis (e.g., eye-tracking, digital problem-solving log analysis) and derive statistically based results (e.g., probability distributions, mean comparisons)."
