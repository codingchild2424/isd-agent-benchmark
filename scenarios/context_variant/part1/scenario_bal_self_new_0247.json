  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Elementary management theories, basic grasp of instructional design principles, and foundational knowledge of social research methodologies (e.g., citizenship, cultural analysis, political-economic relationship studies), along with basic understanding of social institutions and civic engagement activities.",

Specifically aims to strengthen instructional design competencies reflecting core social concepts such as civic rights, economic systems, and cultural diversity.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can propose a design framework (e.g., civic engagement-driven, economic system analysis, cultural comparison) for applying flipped learning-based blended models to business and social research topics (e.g., digital citizenship, political-economic relationships).",
    "For graduate-level social research topics (e.g., digital citizenship, economic relationships), learners can design a three-phase educational plan linking online pre-learning modules (3 modules: civic rights, economic systems, cultural diversity) with offline discussion activities (2 sessions: policy simulation, case analysis), aligned with learning objectives (social problem-solving, critical thinking). The design must achieve ≥80% suitability scores in peer reviews and instructor feedback.",
    "Learners can design two or more social interaction activities (e.g., role-playing for citizen-corporation conflict resolution, case analysis of political-economic relationships) to promote learner engagement through formative assessments."
