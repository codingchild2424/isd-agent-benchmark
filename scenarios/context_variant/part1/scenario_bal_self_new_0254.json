  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Proficiency in secondary-level English grammar and reading comprehension, understanding of multicultural educational environments, basic pedagogical knowledge, and foundational grasp of social studies concepts (history, geography)",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Practice-centered design to strengthen in-service teachers' practical application skills, interactive learning environments using digital devices. Emphasizes social studies integration (e.g., designing English lessons using history/geography content). Integrates project-based learning (PBL) approaches for solving community issues.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can achieve speaking proficiency to explain topics in natural English pronunciation and intonation for over 10 minutes in real-time online classes, establish strategies for culturally contextualized expressions, and integrate social studies (history/geography cases).",
    "Learners can demonstrate five or more interactive teaching methods to engage students in classroom settings, develop effective communication strategies with multicultural learners, and integrate civic rights education.",
    "Trainees can analyze project-based assessment data over a 6-month long-term course to design a feedback system providing individualized written feedback (3+ times), 1:1 coaching (2+ times), and group workshops (1+ time) based on performance outcomes. They can also self-audit compliance with educational policies, develop a model achieving over 80% trainee satisfaction (4+ on a 5-point scale), and apply social studies-based assessment tools (e.g., cultural comparison analysis rubrics)."
