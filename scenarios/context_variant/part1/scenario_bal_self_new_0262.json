  "title": "Program for improving perceptions of effective mathematics pedagogy using PowerPoint: Enhancing visual elements and computational clarity (focusing on function, calculus, and statistics visualization)",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic PowerPoint proficiency, secondary mathematics education experience, fundamental formula editing and graph generation skills, and understanding of basic concepts in functions·calculus·statistics",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A program supporting corporate math job training instructors to recognize the effectiveness of PowerPoint-based teaching methods and develop specific strategies (e.g., formula visualization, animating data analysis processes) to enhance learner engagement. Provides design principles and rubrics for intuitively conveying complex mathematical concepts (equations, derivatives, statistical distributions). Learners are comprehensively evaluated on graph interpretation, calculation accuracy, and visual expression skills.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Recognize functional limitations of PowerPoint (excessive text copying, rapid pacing, etc.) and explain over 3 learner-friendly slide design standards (equation alignment, graph readability, step-by-step animation) with emphasis on mathematical clarity (equation alignment, graph axis labeling, probability distribution visualization).",
    "Learners design instructional materials using over 3 visual elements (diagrams: coordinate planes, animations: step-by-step differentiation, interactive graphs) to explain mathematical concepts (e.g., function graphs, calculus derivatives, statistical distributions) and achieve a suitability rating of 4+ out of 5 in peer reviews and expert evaluations, emphasizing statistical verification including error rate analysis in data interpretation.",
    "Learners establish an action plan to improve existing PowerPoint usage by applying mixed research methods (quantitative data analysis + qualitative feedback surveys), propose over 3 strategies to enhance clarity in formula calculations (3-step verification process: formula application → calculation steps → result verification) and accuracy in data interpretation (error rate within ±5%), including visualization methods for calculus proofs and statistical significance testing."
