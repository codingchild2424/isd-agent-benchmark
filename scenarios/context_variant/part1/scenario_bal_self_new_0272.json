  "title": "[Self-Directed] Social Psychology Theory-Based Instructional Design for Developing Cognitive Learning Potential in Physical Education: Civic Competency Enhancement Approach",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Core principles and practical experience in physical education, experience with VR/simulation-based learning tools, foundational knowledge of sociopsychological theories (e.g., self-determination theory), and basic concepts of civic education and rights promotion",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learners, as physical education practitioners, focus on applying cognitive learning strategies to real-world settings. Blended learning is conducted using VR simulations and mobile apps in smartphone-centric technological environments, emphasizing curriculum design incorporating sociopsychological principles. The educational effectiveness is analyzed in terms of civic engagement and rights enhancement, with community-linked projects reinforcing democratic decision-making skills.",

    "learner_education": "High school",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can analyze strategic thinking processes in physical activities from a socio-psychological perspective and explain cognitive learning frameworks and social interaction strategies for fostering citizenship to learners.",
    "Learners can design three 15-minute practical scenarios applying Self-Determination Theory (autonomy, competence, relatedness) in the Meta Quest 3 VR environment, measure learner engagement (log data ≥80%) and satisfaction (survey ≥4/5 points), and submit a 10-page activity development report analyzing intrinsic motivation effects at the end of a six-month course. Collaborative problem-solving skills and community consciousness are emphasized.",
    "Over a six-month course, learners can develop a customized survey tool measuring academic self-efficacy (5-point Likert scale) and cognitive learning outcomes (pre-post test score differences) using formative assessment data from organizations, derive correlation analysis results (p-value <0.05), contribute to educational system improvements and learner rights enhancement, and cultivate policy proposal skills for expanding civic participation."
