  "title": "[Self-Directed] Metacognition-Based Language Practitioner Self-Awareness Enhancement Course: Integrated Reading, Expression, and Grammar Strategies for Language Education Competency Strengthening",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Secondary education and language teaching experience (including grammar/vocabulary instruction and text analysis), basic digital literacy, and foundational learner writing/reading assessment skills",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "An online course for in-service secondary language teachers, emphasizing the enhancement of metacognition and self-reflection skills through asynchronous LMS-based learning and individualized feedback. The curriculum is structured around real-world cases in language education (e.g., writing feedback, reading strategy design, vocabulary utilization assessment) and highlights specific pedagogical methods for improving learners' expressive and reading comprehension abilities.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can systematically apply metacognitive strategies using Apaydin’s 3A approach (Action-Analysis-Application) in language lesson design to enhance learners’ text-based reading comprehension and situational expression skills.",
    "Learners can accurately diagnose cognitive deficiencies in language learners (e.g., insufficient understanding of grammatical structures, limited vocabulary application, recurring writing errors) with over 80% accuracy and establish corrective strategies using the Problem-Solving Algorithm (PSA) framework.",
    "Learners can create a reflective portfolio explaining the connection between Bloom’s highest cognitive domain (creating·evaluating) and Maslow’s self-actualization needs with three or more concrete examples (e.g., self-expression through creative writing, reflection via peer assessment) and propose two personalized language acquisition motivation strategies (e.g., goal-based vocabulary learning plans, self-directed reading projects)."
