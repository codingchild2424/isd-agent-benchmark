    "Through problem-based learning (PBL), learners can select three nursing problems from real clinical scenarios (e.g., infection control, medication errors, emergency response) and develop a PBL protocol (problem definition → hypothesis setting → data collection → solution derivation → evaluation) that achieves over 80% satisfaction in peer evaluations and instructor feedback."
