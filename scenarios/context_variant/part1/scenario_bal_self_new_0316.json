  "title": "[Self-Directed] Digital Role-Playing Game-Based Program for Enhancing Language Critical Thinking and Reading Strategy Competencies",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic language skills (grammar/vocabulary comprehension, fundamental reading techniques) and digital device experience, with foundational writing ability for in-game text interactions",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A blended teaching program for elementary school teachers and pre-service teachers aimed at strengthening language-related professional competencies. Combines game-based learning with real-time interaction, focusing on improving learners' writing and expressive skills as well as critical reading comprehension. Cultivates practical language abilities through analysis of diverse text types (dialogues, narratives, expository texts) within games.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners improve logical reasoning and text analysis skills by over 30% through solving language scenarios in digital role-playing games and strengthen contextual inference abilities using in-game dialogue/narrative structures.",
    "Learners analyze three or more decision-making scenarios (e.g., character selection, quest resolution methods) in game scenarios, create evaluation matrices considering two or more perspectives (economic, social, ethical) for each choice, and summarize key information with over 80% accuracy by applying reading strategies (keyword extraction, contextual inference, text structure analysis).",
    "Learners increase language learning motivation scores by 25% compared to pre-assessment through game-based learning and develop creative language usage skills via in-game writing/expression activities."
