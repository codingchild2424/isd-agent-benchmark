    "Design personalized training scenarios using VR systems and execute verbal communication strategies (commands, feedback, encouragement) within teams.",
    "Enhance real-time verbal decision-making (commands, feedback, encouragement) in response to environmental changes based on ecological dynamics theory, applying sport-contextual vocabulary and grammatical structures.",
    "Learners explore ≥10 problem scenarios in VR/simulation platforms, design ≥3 creative language strategies (context-specific expressions, nonverbal integration, strategic questioning) suitable for sports contexts, and apply them with ≥80% success rate in actual game situations."
