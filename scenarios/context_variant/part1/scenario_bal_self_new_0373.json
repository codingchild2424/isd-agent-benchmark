    "prior_knowledge": "Elementary experience with e-learning platforms, understanding of secondary education curricula, basic knowledge of language education (reading, writing, speaking, listening), and foundational skills in educational statistics analysis",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A practice-oriented course for in-service secondary school teachers to explore the practicality of e-learning tools in language education. Applies strategies to diverse language education scenarios, from text-based learning to multimedia utilization, with a focus on developing strategies to enhance learners' grammatical application, vocabulary expansion, and cultural understanding.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Using survey tools, identify three or more perceived usefulness factors of e-learning (accessibility, interactivity, language learning suitability, etc.) and analyze their impact on the language acquisition process.",
    "Interpret structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis results to explain the influence of learning environment, lecture delivery methods, tutor characteristics, and support conditions on language education outcomes (reading comprehension improvement, writing proficiency development, communication fluency enhancement, etc.).",
    "In simulation/VR-based educational environments, present five or more criteria for evaluating the practical value of e-learning tools (vocabulary acquisition efficiency, grammar practice effectiveness, pronunciation training support, cultural context reflection, learner engagement, expressive diversity enhancement), and argue how each criterion contributes to language proficiency improvement."
