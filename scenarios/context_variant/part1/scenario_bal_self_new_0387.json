    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Establishing and applying customized feedback strategies using learning analytics tools in job-linked language education for working professionals over 40. Focuses on feedback design reflecting actual language usage contexts such as job-related document writing and presentation delivery. Particularly emphasizes improving vocabulary selection, grammatical accuracy, and expression clarity tailored to job characteristics.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners systematically collect and analyze learner-specific language performance data (e.g., vocabulary frequency, grammatical error patterns, text structure analysis) using learning analytics tools.",
    "Learners design personalized feedback messages reflecting learners' language proficiency levels (reading, writing, listening, speaking) and job-specific characteristics.",
    "Learners develop the ability to interpret learning analytics indicators (e.g., lexical diversity index, error type distribution, appropriateness of expression) for determining feedback frequency and topic selection.",
    "Learners can establish a text-based feedback system linked to language proficiency improvement in small-scale digital environments."
