  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic digital document management experience, smartphone utilization skills, foundational scientific observation/recording understanding, basic experimental data measurement/analysis skills",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learning to build scientific digital repositories using open-source tools in smartphone-centric constrained technology environments. Learners improve report management processes based on practical science field experiences (experimental data management, research report writing), with special focus on systematic storage and analyzability of measurement data. Also supports evidence collection and conclusion-drawing processes for hypothesis verification.",
