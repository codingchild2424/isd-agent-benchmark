  "title": "[K-12] Performance-Centered Language Education Utilizing Text Analysis of Ancient Greek Drama and Expert Mantle Techniques",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational drama theory (dramatic structure, theatrical devices), basic comprehension of ancient Greek culture (city-states, mythology, festivals), and proficiency in fundamental grammar (sentence structure, tense usage) and vocabulary (literary analysis terminology)",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Creating practical language learning environments through digital device use and group collaboration. Learners develop integrated reading (text interpretation), writing (scriptwriting), and speaking (pronunciation and intonation) skills via text analysis (literary criticism techniques), role-playing (context-specific dialogue practice), and performance production (line delivery and expression).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can analyze linguistic features (rhythm, rhetoric, vocabulary selection) and historical/cultural contexts of ancient Greek drama from a modern perspective, and critically evaluate characters' expression methods (dialogue structure, rhetorical devices).",
    "Learners can apply the expert cloak technique to perform roles of characters or production teams (screenwriters, directors, actors) and demonstrate creative problem-solving skills using context-appropriate vocabulary selection (character-specific language styles) and expression strategies (emotional delivery techniques).",
    "Learners can collaborate with 3–5 team members over eight weeks using digital collaboration tools (Notion, Google Workspace, etc.) and offline workshops to plan a drama performance project (2 script text analyses, 1 role-specific dialogue composition, 1 budget plan) and produce a 15-minute performance video achieving \"excellent\" grades in four or more of five evaluation rubric items (creativity, completeness, collaboration, budget management, punctuality)."
