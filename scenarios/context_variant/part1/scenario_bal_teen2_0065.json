  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic exercise science and team sports rules, foundational awareness of social cooperation and cultural diversity, and understanding of civic rights and community systems",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Conducted in an online-offline integrated learning environment using digital devices, emphasizing learners’ civic literacy and collaboration through team-based projects. Develops models applicable to actual school settings by referencing community-linked physical education cases. Particularly recommends program design considering historical and geographical contexts.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners design a physical education program applying ecological dynamics principles, developing agility training modules that emphasize social interaction, environmental adaptation, citizenship, and culturally responsive cooperative activities.",
    "Learners develop ≥3 'representative learning design (RLD)' training tasks in environments simulating real-game contexts, emphasizing teamwork and cultural relevance. They reference community-linked cases to propose models applicable to actual school settings.",
    "In groups of 3–4, learners create one adaptive movement training module for physical education. They achieve ≥80/100 points on a project rubric (creativity 20%, collaboration 30%, practicality 50%) and enhance civic collaboration and problem-solving skills. Feedback considers cultural diversity and institutional contexts."
