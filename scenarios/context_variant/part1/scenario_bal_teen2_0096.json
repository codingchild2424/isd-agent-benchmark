  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic scientific concepts (hypothesis formulation, variable control) and university-level language proficiency (grammar, vocabulary, text analysis basics, foundational pragmatic analysis).",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A graduate-level language program conducting project-based assessments in a technology-limited environment (primarily smartphones). It emphasizes learners' reading comprehension (text structure analysis) and expressive skills (research question formulation), with a focus on analyzing digital language phenomena (experimental design, evidence collection).",

    "learner_age": "In their 20s",
    "learner_education": "High school",
    "learner_role": "Student",
    "domain_expertise": "Beginner"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can systematically observe complex linguistic data (text/audio) to generate scientific hypotheses and analyze relationships between variables.",
    "Learners can perform the process of collecting, categorizing, and critically evaluating linguistic evidence through collaborative problem-solving with peers and conduct mutual assessments based on a 5-point rubric.",
    "Learners can observe three or more real-world linguistic phenomena (e.g., dialect use, neologism creation, pragmatic variation), generate one or more research questions per phenomenon, and achieve problem definition and question-generation skills with an average of 4 or higher on a 5-point rubric through peer evaluation."
