  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Grasp of fundamental geographical concepts, proficiency in digital device utilization, basic academic writing and reading comprehension skills, and experience analyzing diverse text types (explanatory texts, reports)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Integrates digital libraries and collaboration tools into an online environment for practical geography learning aligned with national assessment systems. Focuses on improving learners' text analysis (information extraction, critical reading) and writing (logical structuring, lexical diversity) skills.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners derive three or more cases by analyzing causal relationships between geographical phenomena and strengthen linguistic expression (vocabulary selection, sentence structure) through text-based explanations.",
    "Design a regional environmental comparison project using digital geography resources and present structured analysis (introduction-body-conclusion format).",
    "Collect peer feedback at least three times using online collaboration tools (e.g., Google Docs, Padlet), revise it into a 500-character map analysis report, and submit a result meeting two of three academic writing standards: clear thesis statement, evidence-based arguments, logical structure."
