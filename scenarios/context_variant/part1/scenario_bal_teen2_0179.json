    "Learners can explain the fundamental principles of the five major learning theories (behaviorism, cognitivism, constructivism, social constructivism, and experientialism).",
    "Learners can design curriculum applying learning theories in VR-based simulation environments with over 80% accuracy.",
    "Learners analyze three provided mock lesson scenarios, incorporate five or more peer feedbacks, select one theory (Vygotsky’s sociocultural learning theory or Bandura’s social learning theory), and present two specific educational strategies applying the chosen theory in a lesson design framework (objectives-activities-assessment)."
