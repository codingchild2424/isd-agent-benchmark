  "learning_goals": [
    "Design at least three strategies to apply the three elements of self-determination theory (autonomy, competence, relatedness) to an online Chinese learning environment",
    "Within four weeks, learners can design two gamified motivational activities (mission-based quizzes, team competition tasks) incorporating gamification elements (experience points, leaderboards) for software development training targeting top 10 learners at vocational institutions, achieving ≥80% satisfaction in peer evaluations (average ≥4 on a 5-point scale) and instructor feedback (≥4 out of 5 criteria met).",
    "In a blended environment (online collaboration tools + face-to-face workshops), learners can propose ≥3 social interaction facilitation strategies (e.g., feedback routines, role-division guidelines) using peer feedback systems (Padlet, Google Docs comments), and create an implementation plan meeting ≥4 out of 5 peer evaluation rubric items.",
    "Over a four-week intermediate course, learners can compile a personal motivation maintenance portfolio (3 projects) through project-based assessments (2 sessions) and deliver a 5-minute presentation achieving ≥4 out of 5 rubric items (≥80% fulfillment)."
