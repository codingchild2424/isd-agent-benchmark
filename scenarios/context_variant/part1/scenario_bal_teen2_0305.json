    "Learners apply mathematical concepts required for engineering problem-solving with over 80% accuracy using e-learning tools (e-learning platforms, digital simulations).",
    "Learners comparatively analyze the strengths and weaknesses of e-learning and face-to-face instruction in blended learning environments and develop strategies aligned with their learning styles.",
    "Learners can measure the effectiveness of skill acquisition in the e-learning process through formative assessments and evaluate the applicability to future engineering education."
