  "title": "[K-12] Development Course for Science Inquiry E-Learning Pedagogy Based on the ICARE Learning Model: Strengthening Experimental Design and Variable Control",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic scientific theories, research methodologies, and foundational understanding of experimental design and data analysis. Prior learning in variable control, hypothesis formulation, and scientific observation techniques is essential",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A science inquiry e-learning instructional design process conducted via PBL in smartphone-centric, limited technological settings. Learners enhance scientific reasoning by utilizing virtual simulations that mimic real laboratory environments and data analysis tools. The process emphasizes systematic application of the scientific inquiry cycle (observation → hypothesis → experimentation → analysis → conclusion) in experimental design, refining digital evidence collection and analytical skills.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Cultivate the ability to design scientific inquiry experiments and control independent/dependent variables using the 5-stage ICARE model (Introduction-Connection-Application-Reflection-Extension).",
    "Graduate students can collaborate with 3–5 team members using smartphone-based collaboration tools (e.g., Google Workspace, Slack) to design a 6-month PBL project in the sciences. They must submit deliverables meeting at least four of five evaluation criteria (problem definition clarity, depth of experimental data analysis, systematic hypothesis verification, collaboration efficiency, evidence-based conclusion) in a mid-term report (3rd month) and final presentation (6th month), with an emphasis on observation recording, data measurement, and experimental reproducibility.",
    "Ensure quality management of science e-learning content through expert validation and learner evaluation: Strengthen the ability to improve content by balancing scientific rigor and educational effectiveness."
