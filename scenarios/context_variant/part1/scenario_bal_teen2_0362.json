    "Develop two or more spatial layout designs applying early childhood cognitive development theories (sensorimotor stage, preoperational stage).",
    "Design three or more exhibition zones with verified educational effectiveness through mathematical spatial analysis (area calculation, traffic flow optimization).",
    "Utilizing 3D modeling software (e.g., Tinkercad, Fusion 360), learners can design full-scale virtual spaces (e.g., rooms, classrooms) and perform simulations reflecting physical constraints (wall thickness, door size, etc.) for structural stability and spatial efficiency analysis at least three times."
