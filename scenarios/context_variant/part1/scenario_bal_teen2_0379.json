  "title": "[K-12] Mobile Microlearning Course for Enhancing Science Teaching Pedagogical Competencies: Language-Integrated Approach (Strengthening Scientific Inquiry, Communication, and Literacy)",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "General understanding of basic science knowledge and educational experience, ability to use language effectively for educational purposes (grammar, vocabulary, expression), foundational academic writing skills (APA format, logical structure), and basic multilingual literacy (interpretation of textual and visual materials)",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Mobile-based, practice-oriented curriculum for undergraduate students preparing for science careers. Combines microlearning modules with activity-based learning to provide flexible environments. Focuses on linguistic precision in science communication (terminology accuracy, explanatory coherence), educational communication skills (feedback techniques, presentation abilities), and multiliteracy (text/multimedia interpretation and production).",
    "institution_type": "University (undergraduate)",
    "learner_age": "Teens (13-19)",
    "learner_education": "Elementary",
    "learner_role": "Pre-service/In-service teacher",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will apply theory-practice integration strategies in activity-based science lesson design with 80% or higher accuracy and develop clear language expression skills (vocabulary selection, grammatical accuracy, logical structure) to explain the scientific inquiry process.",
    "Through peer reviews, learners will evaluate and suggest improvements for colleagues’ science education materials at least three times, providing feedback that simultaneously considers educational effectiveness and linguistic accuracy (grammar, terminology appropriateness, sentence structure).",
    "Learners will produce and present three or more microteaching video scenarios in mobile environments, mastering presentation skills (pronunciation, intonation, visual aid utilization) for systematically delivering scientific concepts.",
    "Over six months, learners will systematically compile three types of instructional design documents (lesson plan, assessment rubric, activity design) in a personal portfolio and complete two 2,000-character science education reports that meet academic writing standards (APA format, logical structure, five or more references) and linguistic accuracy (grammar, vocabulary diversity, consistency)."
