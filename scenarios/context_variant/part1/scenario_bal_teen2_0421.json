  "title": "[K-12] Computer Model-Based Integrated Science-Language Education Design Project: Enhancing Text Analysis and Expression Competencies",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Comprehension of basic scientific theories, computer literacy, understanding of fundamental grammar (parts of speech, sentence structure), and text analysis skills (identifying themes, summarizing)",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Supports individual device usage and collaborative learning environments (Google Docs, Padlet), providing continuous feedback through formative assessments. Applies evaluation criteria for AI chatbot dialogue design to strengthen language learning: expression accuracy (minimizing grammar errors), lexical diversity (utilizing over 200 high-frequency words), and contextual coherence (natural dialogue flow). Final outputs are managed as portfolios for process-oriented assessment materials.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Analyze the textual structure (introduction-body-conclusion) and logical flow of science content using computer models explaining phenomena, and develop the ability to translate scientific terminology and concepts into linguistic expressions (explanations, reports).",
    "Learners apply a three-stage PBL process (problem definition-modeling-solution prototyping) to design language learning scenarios (e.g., AI chatbot dialogue) and submit a prototype meeting: 1) natural dialogue flow (≥4/5), 2) appropriate vocabulary (≥4/5), 3) contextual coherence (≥3/5), and 4) ≥4 of 5 presentation rubric items (clarity, lexical diversity, logical consistency, visuals, time management) within two months.",
    "Learners diagnose English proficiency (beginner-intermediate teens) using computer models (e.g., AI learning analytics), then design a 6-week instructional strategy including: 3 grammar sets (tense agreement, conjunctions, articles), 2 vocabulary expansions (thematic lists, collocation practice), and 1 reading activity (short text analysis). The plan must achieve ≥80% suitability in peer/expert reviews."
