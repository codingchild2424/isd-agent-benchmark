  "learning_goals": [
    "Students design one scientific experiment model using smartphone-based makerspace tools (Tinkercad, Fusion 360, etc.) and implement it via 3D printing or virtual simulation to write an experiment report.",
    "Learners write a 500-word report or a 5-minute presentation explaining at least three scientific concepts (e.g., photosynthesis, gravity, atomic structure) acquired during projects in English and achieve over 80% on a provided rubric (grammar accuracy, terminology appropriateness, logical structure).",
    "Students enhance scientific inquiry processes and creative design skills through team-based problem-solving activities."
