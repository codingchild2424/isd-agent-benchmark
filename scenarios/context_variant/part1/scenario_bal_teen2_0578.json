  "title": "[K-12] Advanced Medical and Nursing Education Course Using Technology-Enhanced Simulation: Integrating Social Contexts",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic medical terminology, understanding patient care protocols, familiarity with fundamental nursing skills (symptom observation, safety measures), and foundational awareness of healthcare systems and patient rights",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Simulation/VR-based",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "VR/simulation-based acquisition and assessment of medical/nursing skills in large-scale practical training environments. Scenarios incorporate social contexts (healthcare systems, patient rights, treatment protocols, cultural diversity, social responsibility). Integrates educational goals for community health promotion and civic consciousness development.",
    "institution_type": "Vocational training institution",
    "learner_age": "Teens (13-19)",
    "learner_education": "Middle school",
    "learner_role": "Office worker (administrative/management)",
    "domain_expertise": "Beginner"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Perform basic vital sign measurement and documentation with over 90% accuracy in a simulation environment (compliant with medical protocols and patient rights).",
    "Achieve over 85% compliance with patient safety protocols, emergency response procedures, and medical ethics standards in VR-based scenarios.",
    "Demonstrate medical team collaboration skills at level 4 or higher (5-point scale) through team-based simulation evaluations (emphasizing civic roles and accountability).",
    "Score 80 points or higher (out of 100) on a knowledge assessment after technology-enhanced simulation training (covering medical ethics, legal standards, and social responsibility).",
    "By the end of the 6-month course, learners complete three types of projects reflecting real medical scenarios (e.g., emergency room, operating room, clinic) and propose solutions meeting at least six of eight problem-solving checklist items per task (e.g., patient diagnosis, treatment planning, symptom management, cultural sensitivity)."
