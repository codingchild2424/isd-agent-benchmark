  "title": "[K-12] Online Design Studio-Based Language Design Project: Developing Text-Visual Integrated Expression and Communication Skills",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Grasp of elementary design principles and basic knowledge of linguistic structures (grammar, vocabulary, sentence construction, discourse organization). Proficient in digital tools and possesses basic visual literacy",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A project-based learning environment where students/job seekers solve real-world language design problems (brochures, posters, digital content). The focus is on enhancing expressive and visual communication skills, aiming for a balance between linguistic accuracy and creative visual expression.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Apply the 5-stage language design process (problem definition, idea sketching, prototyping, user testing, iterative improvement) to develop text-based design solutions, integrating linguistic precision and visual effectiveness.",
    "Learners exchange real-time design feedback (grammar, vocabulary, visual expression, readability) with team members using online collaboration tools, improving communication skills.",
    "Learners specify linguistic visual materials (typography, layout, color systems) according to project requirements, generate readable design outputs, and establish expression strategies considering the target audience’s contextual understanding."
