  "title": "[K-12] STEM-Computational Thinking Integrated Mathematics Instructional Design for Special Education Teachers: Multisensory Representation and Experiential Learning Enhancement",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic teaching experience in special education settings, foundational STEM understanding, basic knowledge of middle school mathematics core concepts (equations, functions, geometry), digital tool proficiency, understanding of mathematical representation methods for special education learners",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A program focusing on STEM-computational thinking-integrated mathematics education design for supporting students with hearing and visual impairments. It enhances mathematical expression and problem-solving self-efficacy through collaborative digital pedagogy (shared whiteboards, digital portfolios) and experiential learning (virtual manipulatives, 3D-printed models). Particularly, it optimizes educational effects by introducing multisensory learning materials (tactile graphs, voice feedback systems) and probability/statistics-based assessment methods.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Enhance the ability to design STEM-computational thinking-integrated math lessons for students with hearing and visual impairments, particularly developing multisensory representations of equations, functions, and geometry concepts (e.g., tactile graphs, audio-described formula conversions) and strengthening variable relationship analysis and graph interpretation skills.",
    "Learners develop three experiential math lesson materials for middle school curriculum (linear/quadratic equations, linear/nonlinear functions, planar/3D geometry) using collaborative digital tools like Google Jamboard or Padlet—including one graph visualization tool, one algebraic modeling template, and one geometric transformation simulation—and conduct a 15-minute lesson demonstration achieving ≥80% satisfaction in peer evaluation (average ≥4 points on 5-point scale) and teacher feedback (≥4 out of 5 rubric items). Problem-solving strategies and proof-based approaches are applied.",
    "Learners design ≥3 project-based math teaching-learning models for special education students (intellectual disabilities, learning disorders), each incorporating calculation skills (≥2-step operations), equation interpretation (linear equations), and graph analysis (bar/line graphs), and receive applicability ratings ≥4 points (5-point scale) from special education teachers. Statistical analysis methods for measuring learning effects are also introduced."
