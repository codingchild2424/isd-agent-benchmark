  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners perform fact-checking and source verification (author/publisher confirmation) on three types of digital media content (news articles, videos, SNS posts) and write a critical analysis report meeting at least four of five provided evaluation checklist items (accuracy, fairness, reliability, clarity, impartiality).",
    "Learners propose personal information protection and digital citizenship practices in social media environments and concretely explain safe communication and ethical expression strategies (e.g., respectful language use, objective descriptions).",
    "Learners can analyze three or more media contents (e.g., Instagram Stories/YouTube videos) provided weekly over a 6-month course, then create an action plan in PPT or presentation format that meets at least four of the five checklist criteria: copyright, personal information, misinformation, bias, and social impact. They must deliver a presentation achieving over 80% satisfaction in peer evaluations and instructor feedback. Additionally, they can produce creative alternative content based on their analysis."
