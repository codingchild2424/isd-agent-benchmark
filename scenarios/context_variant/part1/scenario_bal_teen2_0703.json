    "Learners will design one assessment tool measuring higher-order social studies thinking (historical event analysis, cultural context evaluation, creative problem-solving) in a blended learning environment (online+offline) during a one-week intensive course, and present a civic competency enhancement case meeting over 3.5 points (5-point scale) via peer feedback and instructor evaluation",
    "Learners will complete three social studies vocational training scenarios (e.g., community issue resolution, multicultural conflict mediation, civic participation projects) in a VR simulation environment within one week, and submit a self-assessment checklist (participation, problem-solving ability, skill application, civic consciousness) scoring at least 3 points per item (total 12+ points) on a 5-point scale",
    "Trainees will design one project-based assessment task (e.g., local history research, policy proposal writing) promoting reflective learning in social studies within one week, and submit a final report incorporating peer feedback (from ≥2 peers) and instructor evaluation (≥2 points on a 3-point scale)",
