    "Learners can select ≥3 VR-based math education tools (e.g., GeoGebra VR, Mathspace VR), evaluate each on a 1–5 scale according to a provided rubric (≥5 items: educational value, interactivity, accessibility), and write a 1-page comparative analysis report.",
    "Using GeoGebra or Desmos, learners can plan ≥2 educational scenarios applying middle school-level equations, functions, and geometry concepts and submit deliverables (plan + execution examples) meeting ≥4 of 5 peer/teacher feedback criteria (creativity, feasibility, educational impact, technology utilization, student engagement) within the 6-month course."
