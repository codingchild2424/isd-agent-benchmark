    "After observing animations of macroscopic phenomena in the three states of matter (solid/liquid/gas) and phase changes, learners can explain them with 80% accuracy",
    "Learners can analyze solubility processes at the molecular level through animations and explain the concept of saturated solutions by connecting them to experimental data",
    "Learners can describe the effects of thermal energy changes on molecular motion in written form, linked to visual materials"
