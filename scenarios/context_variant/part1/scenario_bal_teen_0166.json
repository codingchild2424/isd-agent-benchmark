    "Identification of five or more technical/educational elements to consider when designing microlearning content using smartphones (e.g., implementation of interactive graphs, step-by-step problem-solving support, real-time feedback systems, probabilistic problem-solving scenarios, and statistics-based analysis tools)",
    "Learners must develop one prototype of a mobile device-optimized (tablet/smartphone) instructional design for elementary mathematics (fraction/decimal operations) within one week per team (3–4 members) and achieve 4+ points (5-point scale) in two out of three peer evaluation rubric items (content suitability, technical implementation, creativity). The prototype must include equation visualization, probabilistic problem-solving elements, and statistical analysis functions"
