  "title": "[K-12] Academic Library Information Literacy Education: Strategies for Enhancing Social Science Research Material Effectiveness (Strengthening Civic Literacy)",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic understanding of smartphone usage, general information retrieval experience, comprehension of fundamental social science concepts (e.g., civic rights, institutions, culture, community issues), and foundational familiarity with library classification systems (e.g., Dewey Decimal Classification)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learners primarily access the LMS via smartphones, requiring self-directed learning in asynchronous environments. Educational materials must be provided in mobile-friendly document formats, focusing on accessibility to research resources in social sciences (history, geography, economics). Learners develop skills in collecting data to address local community issues, strengthening information literacy based on awareness of civic rights and understanding of social relationships.",

    "learner_role": "Student",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners accurately interpret ≥80% of document-based materials explaining academic library database search procedures. They critically evaluate the reliability and cultural contexts of information sources on social science research topics (history, geography, economics, etc.)",
    "Using provided search guides and library classification systems (Dewey Decimal Classification, etc.), learners successfully locate ≥3 academic resources on specific social science topics (e.g., regional economic policies, multicultural phenomena). They assess the scholarly rigor and institutional validity of the materials",
    "Based on 1-week experiences using document-based guides (library handbooks, online manuals) during information searches, learners write ≥3 reflective journals. They submit self-reflections on ≥3 of 5 civic information literacy competencies (information evaluation, source verification, ethical use, etc.) via a self-assessment checklist"
