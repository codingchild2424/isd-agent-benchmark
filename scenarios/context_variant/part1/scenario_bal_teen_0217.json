  "title": "K-12 Affordance-Based Language Teaching Strategies for Digital Learning Material Design: Integrated Reading-Writing-Expression Approach",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic digital tool experience and foundational educational theory knowledge, secondary-level English grammar/vocabulary proficiency, and elementary text analysis/writing expression skills",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course focusing on leveraging interactive affordances of digital learning materials in smartphone-centric limited-technology environments. Aims to strengthen competency in designing and evaluating digital resources for improving learners' language skills (reading, writing, listening, speaking), with emphasis on context-based vocabulary learning and grammar error correction feedback systems.",
    "institution_type": "K-12 school",
    "learner_age": "Teens (13-19)",
    "learner_education": "High school",
    "learner_role": "Pre-service/In-service teacher",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can design at least three integrated reading-writing language learning activities reflecting digital media characteristics (e.g., multimedia, hyperlinks), including text structure analysis and vocabulary expansion strategies.",
    "Learners can analyze the educational affordances (interactivity, accessibility, personalized feedback) of three language learning materials in smartphone-based environments (e.g., educational apps, mobile web) and, based on the analysis, create a checklist-based design proposal (functionality, content, user experience) for at least one applicable vocabulary/grammar learning material, considering automated grammar error detection and context-based vocabulary recommendation systems.",
    "Learners can execute effectiveness verification procedures for three types of digital learning materials (e.g., English vocabulary quizzes, video lectures) using formative assessment tools (Google Forms, Kahoot!, etc.), derive effectiveness metrics of 3+ points (70%+) on a 5-point rubric per item, and measure improvements in reading comprehension and expressive skills, particularly including integrated listening-speaking evaluation items."
