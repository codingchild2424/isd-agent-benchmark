  "learning_goals": [
    "Using ICT tools, one can analyze genre-specific musical proscription constraints and apply creative composition techniques to expand them",
    "Through case studies, compare structural elements of various musical works and produce a polished digital music piece of over three minutes based on this analysis",
    "Continuously improve the composition process by incorporating peer feedback and present the final work in an online portfolio format"
