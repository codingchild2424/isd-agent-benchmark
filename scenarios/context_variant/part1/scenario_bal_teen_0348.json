    "Learners can explain at least three mathematical communication strategies for adapting to local educational environments during overseas training",
    "Learners apply pre-provided flipped learning materials to solve on-site problems, demonstrating ≥80% proficiency in required mathematical theories",
    "By the end of the 2–4 week course, learners will produce a mathematical analysis report (minimum 3 pages) linked to local case studies (e.g., traffic volume near schools, sales data from local stores), including four stages: data collection → graph creation → trend analysis → conclusion derivation. The report must achieve an \"Excellent\" grade in at least two of the three teacher evaluation rubric criteria: clarity, accuracy, and creativity."
