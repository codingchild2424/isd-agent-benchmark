  "title": "[K-12] Project Designing a Mathematics-based Problem-Solving Program for Stroke Patient and Family Care Education",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "General knowledge of basic medical concepts and instructional design, middle school-level math proficiency (algebra, geometry, basic statistics), experience in graph interpretation and application of simple equations",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Math-based medical education design project using collaborative inquiry (CI) and the ADDIE model in smartphone-limited environments. Focuses on real-life problem-solving: graph interpretation for patient rehabilitation data, medication timing calculations, probability-based rehabilitation success rate predictions. Learners develop integrated medical-mathematical problem-solving skills and create educational materials applicable to real patient care scenarios.",

    "Design and implement a learner-level diagnostic tool for analyzing stroke patient rehabilitation data, assessing basic arithmetic skills and foundational statistical concepts.",
    "In 3-member teams, learners use Collaborative Inquiry (CI) methodologies (brainstorming, role division, feedback loops) to derive requirements for 5+ math-based problem-solving educational programs (probability calculations, statistical analysis, graph interpretation, equation applications, etc.) and produce a 1–2-page report within a week that meets at least two of three checklist criteria (clarity, feasibility, pedagogical value).",
    "Develop 4 sessions of math-based rehabilitation education content (e.g., patient status tracking graphs, medication timing calculation tables, probability-based rehabilitation success rate prediction models) following the Analysis-Design-Development stages of the ADDIE model.",
    "Learners create two smartphone-compatible PDFs (rehabilitation log template, calculation practice worksheet) and one video (statistical graph interpretation methods and equation application examples), meeting file size (PDF ≤ 10MB, video ≤ 50MB) and resolution (video ≥ 720p) standards, and complete math education materials that satisfy at least four of five peer evaluation checklist items (accuracy, creativity, practicality, data interpretation skills, appropriate formula application).",
    "During a week-long project-based assessment, learners provide peers with ≥3 specific feedbacks (e.g., suggestions for correcting mathematical errors, improving graph interpretation) and write a daily self-reflection journal recording ≥2 areas for improvement (formula application errors, data interpretation errors, graph analysis errors) in the mathematical problem-solving process."
