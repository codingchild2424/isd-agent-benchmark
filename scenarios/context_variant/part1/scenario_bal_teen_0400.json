  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners select three real-life contextual math problems (e.g., shopping discounts, sports statistics analysis) following RME (Realistic Mathematics Education) principles (phenomenon-guidance-scaffolding-vertical mathematization) and draft a lesson module applying a 5-step instructional design process (problem presentation-investigation-discussion-summarization-evaluation).",
    "Teachers collaborate with three peers via LSLC (Learning Study Learning Community) protocols (biweekly online meetings, shared resource platform) to improve a unit-level lesson plan and establish an implementation plan meeting ≥4 of 5 peer-review checklist criteria.",
    "Learners use multi-tiered assessments (3 formative quizzes + 1 summative project) post-RME lessons to demonstrate ≥80% science concept mastery and ≥2-level improvement (5-point scale) in problem-solving skills."
