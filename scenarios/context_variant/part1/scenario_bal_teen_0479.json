    "Learners can identify three functional issues related to gait, balance, and daily activities in Parkinson’s disease patients and analyze core elements to be included in online self-learning videos (two exercise methods, one safety guideline, one daily activity assistive tool), submitting results in checklist format.",
    "Based on instructional design principles (ADDIE model), learners can select three educational videos for Parkinson’s disease patients and achieve quality evaluation results of ≥4 points (on a 5-point scale) in four or more of the five assessment categories (clarity, appropriateness, interactivity, accessibility, visual effects).",
    "Through project-based learning over 1–6 months, learners can design patient-centered online learning content development plans and write proposals meeting the following conditions: 1) application of three or more patient needs assessment methods, 2) inclusion of five or more interactive elements, 3) average score of ≥3 points (on a 4-point scale) in peer and teacher evaluation criteria."
