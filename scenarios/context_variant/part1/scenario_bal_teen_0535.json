  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic digital tool proficiency, foundational language learning concepts (grammar/vocabulary/pronunciation), core skills in reading/writing/speaking/listening, basic intercultural communication understanding",

Emphasizes digital content creation (writing/multimedia presentations) and collaborative projects (role-playing/feedback sessions) tailored to language domain characteristics. Comprehensive evaluation of learners' reading comprehension, expressive skills, cultural understanding, and language fluency measurement.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "In blended learning environments, create and present three or more language projects utilizing digital tools (blogs, webquests, etc.), including text structure analysis, advanced vocabulary expansion, situational expression evaluation, and grammatical accuracy analysis.",
    "Learners set specific learning objectives for each language skill (reading, writing, speaking, listening) according to backward design principles, develop assessment rubrics (with at least three criteria) aligned with each objective, and design three or more learning activities linked to the rubrics.",
    "Learners perform three VR simulation scenarios (e.g., visiting a market, school life, holiday events) in target language cultural contexts and pass the final evaluation by meeting seven or more of ten situational conversation checklist items (pronunciation, grammar, fluency, lexical diversity, cultural appropriateness, etc.).",
    "Improve language projects twice or more based on peer feedback and formative assessment: enhance writing and presentation skills through feedback incorporation and strengthen expressive abilities."
