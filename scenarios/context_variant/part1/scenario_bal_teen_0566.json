  "learning_goals": [
    "When applying a flipped learning-based blended model to business education, at least three design frameworks reflecting social science concepts—such as market structure, corporate relationships, and resource allocation—should be proposed, considering interactions among economic agents and social responsibility elements.",
    "Learners can link online pre-learning materials (videos, quizzes) with offline activities (discussions, projects) to create three specific social studies lesson plans within two weeks. These plans must meet at least four of the five peer-reviewed and teacher-feedback criteria: creativity, collaboration, practicality, systematic structure, and social impact. Case analyses reflecting economic, political, and cultural contexts are included.",
    "At least two formative assessments can be designed to encourage learner engagement through interactive activities (e.g., role-play, simulated investment games), incorporating elements such as analysis of relationships among economic agents and social responsibility (e.g., ethical decision-making, sustainability)."
