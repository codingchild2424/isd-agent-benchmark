  "title": "[K-12] Flipped Learning-Based Scientific Inquiry Psychology Lecture Design: Strengthening Variable Control and Evidence-Based Approaches",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of foundational psychology theories and pedagogical concepts, basic knowledge of scientific inquiry methods (hypothesis formulation, variable control, data collection/analysis), and ability to design experiments and draw evidence-based conclusions",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Secondary education psychology lecture for pre-service/in-service teachers. Conducted in a blended learning environment using personal devices (BYOD), focusing on lesson design and assessment tool development applying scientific methodologies (observation-hypothesis-experiment-analysis-conclusion). Aims to cultivate the ability to verify educational effectiveness through variable control and evidence-based approaches.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners must explain the core components of the flipped learning model (pre-learning materials, activity-based instruction) with over 80% accuracy, analogizing them to the scientific inquiry process (hypothesis formation–experiment design–data analysis–conclusion drawing).",
    "Through group discussions with peer teachers, learners must apply core psychology concepts (cognitive development, learning theories) to actual classroom cases, proposing lesson designs that utilize independent/dependent variable control and evidence-based approaches.",
    "Based on theories acquired through pre-learning videos and quizzes, learners must participate at least 90% in role-play activities (systematic observation–quantitative measurement–statistical analysis) conducted in classrooms, performing reflective thinking using experimental data."
