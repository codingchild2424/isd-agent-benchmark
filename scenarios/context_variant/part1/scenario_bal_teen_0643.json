  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners perform real-time feedback with team members at least three times while drafting a math paper using collaborative web-based tools and develop document version control skills.",
    "Over six months, learners will maintain a strategic 70:30 usage ratio (70% for text space/content organization, 30% for interface/tool functionality) in online collaborative projects (e.g., Google Docs, Padlet), and design efficient collaboration processes achieving an average score of 4/5 or higher on evaluation rubrics (clarity, engagement, efficiency) across three or more projects.",
    "Over six months, learners will compile monthly portfolios of asynchronous communication records (chat logs, emails, shared documents) from math research paper writing processes (3+ instances/month) and incorporate two or more communication insights into the introduction-methods-results structure of the final paper."
