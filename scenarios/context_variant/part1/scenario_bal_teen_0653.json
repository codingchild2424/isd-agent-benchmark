  "title": "[K-12] Mobile-Based Online Language Course Design Workshop: Integrated Vocabulary and Grammar Pedagogy",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational instructional design theory and experience with online educational tools, intermediate language proficiency (reading, writing, listening, speaking), and basic vocabulary expansion and grammar analysis skills.",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Enhancing language education content design competencies in smartphone-accessible microlearning environments. It emphasizes activity design to improve K-12 learners’ reading comprehension (text analysis, contextual inference) and expressive abilities (writing, oral presentation). Focus is on developing context-based vocabulary learning and grammar exercises suitable for mobile environments.",
    "institution_type": "Corporate/Enterprise",
    "learner_age": "Teens (13-19)",
    "learner_education": "Middle school",
    "learner_role": "Professional (medical/legal/technical)",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can identify over 80% of core elements (feedback systems, multimedia materials) in mobile-optimized online language lectures, focusing particularly on vocabulary acquisition (verb conjugations, idiomatic expressions) and grammar practice (sentence structure analysis, tense exercises) modules.",
    "Learners can propose three or more interaction design solutions implementable in limited technology environments (smartphone-only) (e.g., text-based quizzes, voice recording feedback, image association learning), and explain how each contributes to improving learners' reading comprehension and expressive skills.",
    "Learners can develop one prototype of a practical language learning module through project-based assessment within a week, submitting results meeting four or more of five predefined evaluation checklist items (functional implementation, user convenience, learning effectiveness, vocabulary diversity, grammatical accuracy). The prototype must reflect balanced development of K-12 learners' language skills (reading, writing, listening, speaking)."
