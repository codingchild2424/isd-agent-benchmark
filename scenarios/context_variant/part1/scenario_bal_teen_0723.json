  "title": "[K-12] Optimizing Language Knowledge Transfer in International Joint Ventures: Text Analysis and Communication Competency Strengthening",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Experience in inter-company collaboration, basic concepts of international business, ability to distinguish tacit/explicit knowledge, and foundational foreign language communication skills (integrated listening/speaking/reading/writing)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Simulation/VR-based",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "VR-based international joint venture simulation emphasizing cross-cultural knowledge sharing (vocabulary expansion for language barriers, cultural context integration). Utilizes text-based collaboration tools (chat/document sharing) and incorporates grammar accuracy assessments.",
    "institution_type": "K-12 school",
    "learner_age": "Teens (13-19)",
    "learner_education": "High school",
    "learner_role": "Pre-service/In-service teacher",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can analyze explicit knowledge transfer mechanisms in international joint ventures using structural equation modeling and interpret interconnections between technical terms and texts within linguistic contexts.",
    "Learners can explain the differential impact of psychic distance on tacit/explicit knowledge transfer (especially linguistic expression and communication strategies) through case comparisons.",
    "In virtual simulation environments (e.g., Minecraft Education Edition), learners can complete three knowledge diffusion scenarios, apply two integrated listening-speaking communication strategies in multinational teams (3–4 members), and achieve an 80% or higher task completion rate."
