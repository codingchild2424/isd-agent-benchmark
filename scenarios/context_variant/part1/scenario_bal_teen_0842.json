  "title": "[K-12] VR-Based Ecological Dynamics Theory-Integrated Sports-Language Communication Competency Enhancement Program",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic sports science knowledge, VR technology experience, intermediate-level comprehension of sports-related vocabulary/grammatical structures, and foundational listening/speaking abilities",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "An integrated educational program aiming to strengthen real-time decision-making skills through the construction of personalized sports training environments using digital devices and the application of ecological dynamics theory. Simultaneously, it targets the acquisition of sport-specific language expressions (game analysis, strategy discussion, team communication, feedback exchange). Special emphasis is placed on improving overall language proficiency through integrated listening, speaking, reading, and writing activities.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Design personalized training scenarios using VR systems and execute language learning scenarios integrating sport-specific vocabulary, expressions, and grammatical structures for situational contexts.",
    "Based on ecological dynamics theory, this enhances real-time decision-making skills in response to environmental changes and implements situation-specific communication strategies (e.g., team strategy discussions, opponent analysis expression, post-game feedback) with linguistic accuracy (grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation) and fluency (speed, intonation).",
    "Learners explore at least 8 out of 10 sports-language integrated scenarios in a VR-based language learning platform, design and apply two or more creative problem-solving strategies (e.g., role-play dialogues, situational vocabulary usage, sports terminology application) per scenario, and achieve 3+ points (out of 5) in peer evaluations and teacher rubrics (creativity, feasibility, linguistic accuracy, fluency)."
