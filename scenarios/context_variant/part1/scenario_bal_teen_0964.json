  "title": "[K-12] Designing High School Biology Teaching Methods Using Digital Technology: Language-Integrated Inquiry Approach",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "High school-level biology basics (cell structure, genetic laws, etc.), digital tool proficiency, scientific writing skills, and understanding of academic vocabulary (experiment, observation, hypothesis, variables, evidence, conclusion, etc.)",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course enhancing the ability to design and implement digital technology-based lessons in biology education. When conducting simulation projects reflecting real school environments, learners articulate the scientific inquiry process (hypothesis formulation, experimental design, data analysis, conclusion) clearly and apply effective communication skills (active listening, clear expression, constructive feedback) in collaborative settings. It particularly focuses on developing academic discourse skills (scholarly writing, presentations, discussions) in digital environments.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Using digital simulation tools (virtual labs, 3D modeling), learners can explain molecular genetics concepts (e.g., DNA replication, transcription, translation) using at least three scientific terms and report experimental results in structured text (hypothesis-process-results-conclusion format).",
    "Learners can design ICT-based assessment rubrics (e.g., Google Forms, Padlet) to measure project-based learning outcomes (presentation, collaboration, creativity) on a 5-point scale, achieving over 80% reliability in peer evaluations while writing clear feedback. Particularly, the ability to provide critical analysis and constructive suggestions on peers’ presentations is strengthened.",
    "Teachers can design a 4-week PBL class using Google Workspace and Padlet in a BYOD environment, submit a lesson plan including learner collaboration activities (3 document shares, 2 discussion board posts), and achieve an \"excellent\" rating in at least four of five peer teacher evaluation rubric items. Additionally, academic vocabulary (analysis, hypothesis, variable, evidence, etc.) is appropriately used in all communications.",
    "Learners can discover and repurpose at least five types of biology digital content (AR/VR materials) for educational purposes, write accurate scientific terminology and descriptions for content explanations, and cultivate scientific writing skills to systematically organize observations from virtual experiments."
