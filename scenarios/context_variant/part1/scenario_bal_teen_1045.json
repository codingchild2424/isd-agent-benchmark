    "prior_knowledge": "Basic scientific knowledge and general understanding of special education",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Students engage in web-based experiential learning using individual devices, while in-person sessions focus on project feedback and collaborative learning. They explore online content design methods reflecting the needs of special education students with diverse cognitive styles",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners design a web-based experiential learning module considering the cognitive styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic) of special education students and verify its functional validity through peer evaluation and a checklist (meeting at least 4 out of 5 criteria).",
    "Learners input scientific experiment data (temperature, mass, time, etc.) into a spreadsheet, analyze patterns in experimental results by calculating averages/deviations and generating graphs (bar/line charts), and write a report meeting at least 2 out of 3 teacher-provided checklist criteria (data accuracy, logical analysis, clarity of visualization).",
    "Learners apply at least three visual supports (magnifiers, high-contrast materials) and auditory supports (voice descriptions, subtitles) during science-linked experiential activities (plant observation, chemistry experiments) and achieve satisfaction survey scores of 4+ (on a 5-point scale) from over 80% of participating students.",
    "In a 3-week project-based assessment, learners build a simple solar-powered car and submit a result meeting three evaluation criteria: functionality (driving distance ≥5m), creativity (≥2 unique design elements), and completeness (no structural defects). They also incorporate ≥3 peer feedbacks and propose ≥2 improvement plans (e.g., battery efficiency, lightweight chassis) in a 1-page proposal."
