    "Learners select two computer-assisted language learning activities (e.g., digital flashcards, language apps) via three weekly educational blogging sessions, analyzing each in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and expression using a structured template with three-step reflections (strengths/limitations/improvements).",
    "Learners successfully complete a project applying language learning knowledge (e.g., reading strategies, writing skills, text structuring) to new educational contexts with ≥80% success, based on reflective thinking.",
    "Learners demonstrate ≥2 instances of qualitative improvement in blogging content (e.g., text structuring, lexical diversity, contextual expressiveness) through peer feedback."
