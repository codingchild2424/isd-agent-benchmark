  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic science subject knowledge (experimental design, data analysis), experience with digital educational materials, understanding of the scientific inquiry process (observation→hypothesis→experiment→analysis→conclusion), and familiarity with variable control and evidence-based conclusion methods",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Community platform case studies and methodologies for science teachers to share and reuse learning design templates. Focuses on strengthening core competencies in experimental design (variable control), data analysis (measurement and graphing), and scientific argumentation (evidence-based conclusions). Includes simulation cases of inquiry processes using virtual lab tools.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Using a learning design sharing platform, learners will share at least three experiment/observation-centered lesson designs with peer science teachers and provide evidence-based feedback (utilizing measurement data).",
    "When reusing learning designs, learners will apply at least two adaptation strategies tailored to educational contexts (e.g., variable control, hypothesis setting), including control group design and result interpretation.",
    "A completed science lesson plan integrating digital learning materials (e.g., virtual lab tools) with the scientific inquiry process (observation → hypothesis → experiment → analysis → conclusion)"
