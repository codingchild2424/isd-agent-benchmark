  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational geology and chemistry concepts, awareness of basic scientific inquiry report structure (introduction-methods-results-analysis-conclusion), and basic proficiency with digital tools (documents·presentations)",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Conducting field research and data analysis projects using digital devices. Learners refine skills in writing integrated text-visual reports, presentation expression techniques, and improve communication abilities through peer evaluation feedback.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Apply core concepts of mineralogy, petrology, and geochemistry (MPG) to project contexts and explain them in a scientific inquiry report (introduction-methods-results-analysis-conclusion).",
    "Secure the ability to analyze and interpret real geological samples through team-based investigative activities and express findings in structured text (including graphs/tables).",
    "Learners organize science experiment results in a 5-stage structure (introduction-methods-results-analysis-conclusion) using digital tools (Google Docs, Canva, etc.), create a 3-minute presentation, and achieve a 'B' (80–89 points) or higher in 4 out of 5 peer evaluation rubric items (clarity, logic, creativity, visuals, time management)."
