  "learning_goals": [
    "Design three or more e-learning scenarios incorporating gamification elements (game mechanics, motivation systems).",
    "Develop and apply an e-learning usability evaluation tool through project-based collaboration.",
    "Learners analyze learning motivation and engagement metrics (e.g., 80% attendance rate, 70-point quiz average, 4/5 survey satisfaction) of a corporate education program for teenagers and write a 5-page report including three data-driven improvement strategies.",
    "Within four weeks, learners design one gamification prototype (Lo-fi/Hi-fi) in digital device environments (tablets/smartphones). They reflect feedback from peer reviews and user testing (5+ participants) to improve at least two of three functionality items in the prototype."
