  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic mathematical concepts (arithmetic, geometry, algebra) and basic awareness of educational settings, simple formula calculation skills, fundamental graph interpretation abilities (bar charts, line graphs)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A practice-centered course for pre-service/in-service teachers to strengthen math instructional competency. Emphasizes teaching methods using manipulatives to support elementary students' abstract thinking development and problem-solving assessment techniques. Covers concrete instructional strategies for geometry (measuring sides/angles of shapes) and algebra (solving linear equations and analyzing variable relationships).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Explain the step-by-step application principles of the concrete-to-abstract teaching method (manipulation → representation → abstraction) and apply them to designing lessons utilizing formulas and graphs (coordinate planes, function graphs) for math problem-solving",
    "Present ≥3 instructional tools (tangrams, geoboards) and digital tools (GeoGebra, Desmos, graphing calculators) that aid concept understanding in geometry/algebra domains and analyze actual classroom cases",
    "Within one week, learners orally present a developed instructional model through project-based assessment (3 math problem-solving projects: equation solving, geometric measurement, pattern analysis) to ≥3 peers and receive an \"Excellent\" rating in ≥1 of 2 feedback criteria (creativity, practicality). Special emphasis is placed on variable relationship analysis in equation solving, measurement accuracy in geometric measurement, and sequence pattern identification in pattern analysis"
