  "learning_goals": [
    "Apply six student-centered e-learning design principles based on mathematics curriculum (e.g., equation visualization, graph interpretation, probability modeling) to develop educational scenarios for algebra, geometry, and statistics concepts.",
    "Perform collaborative design processes with peer teachers following DBR (Design-Based Research) methodology, derive customized strategies for math concepts through learning data analysis, and establish a proof-based feedback system.",
    "Learners analyze biweekly (twice weekly) math problem-solving results (equations, functions, statistics) using smartphone-based formative assessment tools (e.g., Kahoot!, Quizizz), identify ≥3 concepts with ≥20% reduced error rates, and create personalized learning plans to improve formula application and graph interpretation skills."
