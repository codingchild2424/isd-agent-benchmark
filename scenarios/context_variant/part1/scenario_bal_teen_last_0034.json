  "title": "Designing Blended Teaching Methods for Distance Language Learning: Enhancing Pre-Service Teachers’ Sociocultural Competencies and Citizenship",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic digital device usage skills, elementary-level target language comprehension, foundational awareness of diverse cultural backgrounds, and general understanding of rights and responsibilities as a societal member",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Aims to strengthen language-culture integrated competencies required for pre-service/in-service teachers, applying blended teaching methods optimized for learners aged 40+ with technological constraints. Includes activities to enhance civic rights awareness (recognizing rights in multicultural societies) and multicultural understanding (analyzing cross-cultural conflict resolution scenarios). Strengthens practical competencies through community-linked projects (e.g., collaboration with local multicultural centers).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners explain adaptation strategies reflecting socio-cultural contexts (e.g., local festivals, historical events, daily customs) in language learning materials for remote environments and apply them to actual classes.",
    "Through LMS-based asynchronous activities (cultural comparison discussions, situational role-play recordings, etc.), learners enhance writing·speaking proficiency in the target language alongside cultural expression comprehension (e.g., idioms, non-verbal communication).",
    "Over 6 months, learners design 1 language-culture integrated education case applying blended teaching methods (3:2 online/offline activity ratio) through project-based assessments (including cross-cultural communication simulations), achieving ≥70% in each evaluation criterion (creativity 25%, feasibility 25%, cultural integration 25%, presentation effectiveness 25%) from peer and teacher reviews, incorporating multicultural citizenship elements."
