  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic digital literacy, smartphone usage skills, and foundational understanding of elementary science experiment procedures (hypothesis formulation, variable control, data recording)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Foundational course focusing on designing science inquiry lessons using ChatGPT in Malaysian public education. Practical approach emphasizing observation/measurement/analysis activities in smartphone-based limited environments. Recommends experiment topics reflecting local contexts (tropical climate, multicultural society).",

    "learner_age": "Teens (13-19)",
    "learner_education": "Elementary",
    "learner_role": "Student",
    "domain_expertise": "Beginner"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Understand the basic functions of ChatGPT and explain how to apply them to the scientific inquiry process (hypothesis formulation, variable control, experimental design) in elementary science classes.",
    "Identify at least three ethical considerations, such as the potential of generative AI to support the scientific inquiry process, data bias, algorithmic limitations, and misinterpretation of results.",
    "Learners can use ChatGPT in a smartphone environment to design three science experiments (e.g., plant growth observation, chemical reaction measurement, physical phenomenon analysis) and create an activity plan within a week, including step-by-step procedures (observation, measurement, analysis) and expected outcomes.",
    "Propose at least two strategies for maintaining academic integrity and deriving conclusions based on scientific evidence (experimental data, observation records) when using AI tools."
