    "Explain methods to apply core concepts of computational thinking (decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, algorithms) in educational settings",
    "Design educational activities for early childhood and elementary levels using block-based programming tools (e.g., Scratch)",
    "Plan and implement basic coding activities using robotics kits",
    "Over two weeks, learners will design three integration strategies for blended learning environments: 1) online quiz ↔ offline small-group feedback linkage, 2) discussion board topic selection ↔ offline activity linkage, 3) digital portfolio ↔ face-to-face evaluation session integration. They will propose actionable plans achieving ≥4/5 (80% satisfaction equivalent) in learner engagement surveys (5-point Likert scale)."
