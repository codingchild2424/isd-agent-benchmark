  "title": "[K-12] Constructivist-Based Programming Fundamentals and Computational Thinking Improvement Course: Enhancing Language Expression Through Text-Based Problem-Solving Skills",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic computer literacy, foundational logical thinking, understanding of simple English/Korean programming terminology, experience with basic grammatical structures and technical writing",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A blended educational curriculum combining game-based learning elements and project-based assessment in a mobile environment utilizing digital devices. It focuses on developing linguistic expression (grammar, vocabulary, logical explanation) and computational thinking simultaneously through code writing and documentation in text-based coding environments (Scratch/Entry). Particularly, it emphasizes linguistic interaction and text production skills in the processes of writing code comments, creating reports, and peer evaluation.",

    "learner_age": "Teens (13-19)",
    "learner_education": "Elementary",

    "domain_expertise": "Beginner"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will design simple text-based programs using sequential and concurrent programming concepts and enhance logical expression skills and technical documentation abilities through code commenting and pseudocode writing.",
    "Over four weeks, learners will perform collaborative activities (pairing/group quizzes) twice weekly on mobile-based microlearning platforms (e.g., Kahoot!, Quizlet) and achieve over 80% proficiency in three of four computational thinking rubric areas (problem decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, algorithm design). Additionally, they will use clear language expression (grammatical accuracy, vocabulary selection, logical explanation) during peer feedback.",
    "Through project-based assessments, learners will apply programming concepts to real-world problem-solving and demonstrate structured text writing and academic expression skills via reports following the introduction-methods-results-conclusion format."
