  "title": "Mobile-Based Elementary Advanced Language Competency Development Program: Scientific Inquiry Approach for Text Analysis, Writing, and Expressive Skills Enhancement",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational language structure (grammar, vocabulary), understanding of educational theories (instructional design principles) and digital literacy. Additionally, experience with basic text analysis principles (identifying themes, contextual understanding) and creative writing techniques (metaphor, description)",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A mobile-optimized curriculum integrating small-scale personalized learning with digital devices, combining language education practice (text generation/revision) and theory (communication strategies). Focuses on enhancing reading comprehension, expressive skills, and critical thinking. Utilizes interactive mobile platform features (voice recording, real-time feedback) to strengthen integrated speaking/listening activities, incorporating scientific inquiry methods (observation-hypothesis-experiment-conclusion) into language learning.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Within 6 months, learners will complete 12 mobile-based language education modules (vocabulary expansion, grammatical structures, text analysis, etc.) with over 85% completion accuracy. Through hypothesis-setting, observation, and analysis processes for each module, they will systematically investigate linguistic phenomena.",
    "Learners will achieve 90% accuracy in formative assessments by analyzing and critically evaluating language education materials (literary texts, practical texts, etc.). They will derive evidence-based conclusions focusing on text structure, vocabulary usage, and rhetorical techniques.",
    "Over a 6-month long-term course, learners will undertake three project-based assignments and develop two types of language instruction designs (e.g., reading activity design, creative writing lesson plans) applicable to corporate language education programs. Each design must incorporate feedback on at least four of five peer/expert review items, and the final designs must score 4.0/5.0 or higher on an institutional rubric (clarity, practicality, creativity, effectiveness, feasibility). Notably, learner-tailored expression strategies (integrating speaking/writing) and communication theories are applied during the design process."
