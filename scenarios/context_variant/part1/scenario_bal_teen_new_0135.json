  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic language communication skills (reading, writing, listening, speaking), adaptability to online discussion environments, and foundational grammar understanding. Basic proficiency in text structure analysis and vocabulary inference is also required",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Emphasizes discussion activities in offline environments using digital devices. Provides comprehensive language proficiency assessment (reading, expression, analysis) and feedback through project-based evaluation. Particularly focuses on intertextual comparative analysis and critical expression skills.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "In structured online discussions, learners enhance text-based discussion skills and vocabulary analysis abilities by utilizing four types of linguistic messages: argumentation, criticism, evidence presentation, and explanation.",
    "During discussions, learners apply Bloom’s cognitive learning domains (understanding, application, analysis, evaluation, synthesis) to reading comprehension and expression activities, achieving all five levels. Particularly, they strengthen text structure analysis and logical expression skills.",
    "Learners can compose a logical response message of approximately 150 characters by applying two or more higher-order thinking strategies—'Questioning,' 'Evidence Provision,' or 'Alternative Proposal'—to three peer argumentative or critical messages. This process considers grammatical accuracy and coherence between texts."
