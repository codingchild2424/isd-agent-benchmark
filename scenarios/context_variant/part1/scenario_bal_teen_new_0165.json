  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Core scientific concepts (experimentation, observation, hypothesis formulation, variable control) and logical reasoning skills, along with basic proficiency in digital tools.",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "In a digitally enabled collaborative learning environment, this course provides customized scaffolding based on learners’ prior knowledge levels and emphasizes scientific inquiry processes (measurement, analysis, evidence collection, conclusion). It is systematically designed to practice variable control and hypothesis verification.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners collaboratively design concept maps linking core concepts (variables, hypotheses, experimental design) of a given science topic (e.g., photosynthesis, ecosystems).",
    "Learners visualize hierarchical structures (observation → measurement → analysis → conclusion) between concepts using digital tools (CmapTools) with varying levels of scaffolding support.",
    "Learners improve the logical consistency (scientific evidence connectivity, causal relationships between variables) of concept maps by ≥80% through peer evaluation."
