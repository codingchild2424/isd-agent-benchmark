    "Learners can analyze formative assessment results (items with less than 70% correct answer rates) to diagnose three major limitations of textbook materials (e.g., content errors, insufficient explanations, lack of practical applicability) and propose 1–2 improvement strategies per limitation (e.g., adding case studies, revising terminology, linking to practical exercises)."
