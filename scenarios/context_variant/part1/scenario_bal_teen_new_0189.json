    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "In a smartphone-based VR simulation-driven practical education environment, learners integrate text analysis/writing/presentation activities related to radiation safety to holistically develop language skills (reading, writing, expression). Emphasizes specialized terminology, logical structuring, and visual aid integration.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Explain and perform patient positioning procedures in a simulated environment with 90% accuracy using radiation safety protocol terminology (e.g., dose, shielding, exposure) in scientific texts.",
    "Use virtual reality simulation tools to express radiation exposure calculation results as graphs/tables/descriptive texts, practice optimization strategies three+ times, and present findings in a logical problem-solution structure.",
    "In a 4-member team-based scenario, learners develop three radiation emergency response procedures in a project format (proposal, PPT), and deliver presentations applying five+ specialized terms and logical expression skills (problem-solution structure, comparative analysis) to meet 4/5+ (80%+) rubric criteria."
