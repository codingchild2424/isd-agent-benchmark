  "title": "[K-12] Bio-terror Preparedness Language-integrated Escape Game Development Workshop: Strengthening Scientific Inquiry and Communication Strategies",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic public health knowledge, experience in emergency response, understanding of foundational language teaching methodologies (integrated reading/writing/speaking activities), basic grasp of the scientific inquiry process (hypothesis formation–experimentation–analysis)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Strengthens disaster preparedness simulation design capabilities applicable to language education (grammar, vocabulary, expression) for pre-service/in-service teachers. Focuses on contextual learning environments using science-language integration (STEAM). Learners enhance language skills and problem-solving abilities through text analysis, specialized terminology acquisition, and situational expression strategies based on real bioterrorism scenarios.",

    "learner_age": "Teens (13-19)",

    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "In a bioterrorism scenario-based escape game, learners achieve ≥80% goal completion rate within 60 minutes using teamwork and problem-solving strategies, and analyze situational communication strategies (e.g., negotiation dialogues, emergency instruction interpretation) from linguistic and pragmatic perspectives.",
    "Learners explain the design principles of escape games combining digital tools and physical puzzles and develop text-based puzzles (e.g., cipher decoding, technical term matching) and role-play templates (e.g., patient symptom description dialogues) applicable to language education contexts.",
    "Through formative assessments, learners meet team collaboration efficiency metrics (participation rate ≥85%, idea contribution count) and propose specific plans for improving language expression (e.g., frequency analysis of technical terms, contextual vocabulary selection evaluation)."
