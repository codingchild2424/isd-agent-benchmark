  "title": "[K-12] Blended Learning-Based Creative Problem-Solving (CPS) Process Design: Strengthening Critical Thinking and Text Analysis in Language Curriculum Contexts",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic problem-solving skills, digital device proficiency, secondary-level grammar/vocabulary comprehension, and introductory text analysis (theme identification, contextual inference, logical flow recognition)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A process emphasizing the cultivation of real-world problem-solving skills (e.g., argumentative writing, debate preparation, presentation material development) through CPS training linked to language subjects (reading, writing, speaking, listening). Activities are designed to improve learners' expressive abilities, reading comprehension, and critical thinking. Contextual understanding is reinforced through analysis of diverse text types (narrative, expository, argumentative).",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can systematically resolve language-related problems (e.g., text structure analysis, vocabulary selection, logical expression) from discovery to acceptance planning using the CPS 6-stage model and strengthen their ability to derive conclusions based on analytical results.",
    "Learners can apply creative thinking skills (idea generation, metaphor utilization, context-based vocabulary expansion) in a blended learning environment combining digital tools (pads/tablets) and paper-based activities (mind maps, writing notebooks).",
    "Learners can revise writing assignments by incorporating at least three types of peer feedback (grammar accuracy, lexical diversity, logical coherence) and achieve 4+ points in at least two out of three critical thinking criteria (evidence provision, multidimensional analysis, logical coherence) on a 5-point rubric provided by instructors, while demonstrating lexical accuracy and expressive consistency in the revised text."
