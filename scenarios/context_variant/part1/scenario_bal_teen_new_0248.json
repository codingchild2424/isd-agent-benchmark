  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic earth science concepts and understanding of solar system components, fundamental communication skills for collaborative problem-solving, introductory awareness of citizen science projects",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A program for pre-service teachers and job seekers, this course explores planetary science education methods applicable in elementary education settings. It develops an educational model integrating scientific inquiry and social collaboration competencies, with a focus on strengthening citizen science capabilities for future generations' sustainable development.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Analyze geological structures (stratigraphy, volcanic terrain) and atmospheric characteristics (composition, pressure) of three planets (e.g., Mars, Venus) in a VR environment. In 3–4 person teams, learners solve a geological exploration mission (e.g., resource extraction site selection) within two weeks, write a collaborative report, and recognize the scientific inquiry process and social responsibility as citizen scientists",
    "Learners systematically record observational data (temperature, humidity, precipitation, etc.) in tabular format ≥once weekly in a Digital Science Journal (DSJ), provide specific feedback (e.g., data accuracy, analysis methods) to three team members, and foster a collaborative learning culture by writing feedback meeting ≥4/5 peer evaluation checklist items",
    "By designing virtual experiments based on planetary formation theories, predicting outcomes, and engaging in team discussions, students explore the scientific decision-making process and methods for reaching social consensus"
