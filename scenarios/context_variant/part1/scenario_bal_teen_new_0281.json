  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic science concepts and everyday problem-solving experience, foundational language expression skills for scientific inquiry reports (observation recording, hypothesis formulation, conclusion writing), understanding of academic vocabulary and basic grammatical structures",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Designing smartphone-based learning activities (voice recording, text analysis tools), utilizing science inquiry scenarios linked to daily life (field observation documentation, data interpretation text writing), enhancing scientific writing feedback and expression accuracy through peer review, and gaining experience in creating multimodal texts using multimedia resources (images, charts).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can explain how linguistic expressions (observation records, hypothesis statements, conclusion writing) in the scientific inquiry process influence creative thinking and critical expression skills",
    "Through Problem-Based Learning (PBL), learners experience solving real-life problems via the scientific inquiry process (hypothesis formation → experiment design → data analysis → language-based conclusion) and express this as structured text",
    "Using advanced organizers (concept maps, vocabulary maps), learners understand connections between scientific concepts, apply creative approaches through linguistic expressions (tables, graph descriptions, report writing), and integrate academic vocabulary with everyday language",
    "Over two weeks, learners complete formative assessments twice weekly (science experiment design reports, data analysis text interpretation, conclusion writing) and achieve ≥80% proficiency in three of five rubric criteria (creativity, accuracy, logic, collaboration, self-reflection), while proposing two specific language expression improvements (notation, logical connectors) based on teacher feedback"
