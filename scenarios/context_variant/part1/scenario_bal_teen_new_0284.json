  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic argumentation structures, science content knowledge, and understanding of experimental design/measurement methods. Familiarity with scientific inquiry processes and variable control concepts",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course focusing on enhancing science pre-service teachers' ability to design argumentation lessons using experimental data in BYOD environments. Integrates scientific inquiry processes with evidence analysis, aiming for lesson designs based on scientific methodologies (observation-measurement-analysis-conclusion).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "In science argumentation classes, learners systematically analyze experimental variables using semiotic tools (symbols, diagrams) and design discussions based on the scientific inquiry process.",
    "Through role assignments (pro/con/judge) in a 5-stage argumentation cycle (preparation-claim-refutation-evaluation-reflection), learners strengthen hypothesis verification and variable control skills and derive evidence-based conclusions.",
    "Learners create argumentation activities based on mobile science experiment outputs, complete project-based assessments by analyzing measurement errors in peer feedback, and perform evidence-based improvements."
