    "Participants design three or more instructional strategies to effectively integrate non-gameplay elements of video games (e.g., narrative, visual components) into mathematics instruction.",
    "Participants analyze problem situations arising from digital technology integration in educational settings and propose solutions using a hermeneutic phenomenological approach.",
    "Participants will design one VR/simulation-based mathematics learning module in a BYOD environment and develop three or more formative assessment items (e.g., quizzes, observation checklists, peer evaluations), achieving learner satisfaction of over 80% after a two-week pilot implementation."
