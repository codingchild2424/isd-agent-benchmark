  "title": "[K-12] Language Competency (Reading, Writing, Expression, Grammar) Enhancement Course Using MOOC-Based Self-Regulated Learning and Social Mirroring",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic language proficiency (reading, writing, speaking) and experience with digital devices, understanding of fundamental grammatical structures (parts of speech, tenses, sentence structure), and ability to perform simple text analysis",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Simulation/VR-based",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "VR environment configuration to promote social interaction among learners and visualization tools for individual learning progress. Focuses on text-based collaborative activities (joint writing/feedback exchange) and expressive skills enhancement (pronunciation, intonation, fluency) through voice feedback. Provides exemplary case videos and peer assessment rubrics for social mirroring.",

    "learner_age": "Teens (13-19)",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners monitor peer language task progress (text analysis·vocabulary frequency) in VR simulation environments, apply self-regulated learning strategies (time management·goal setting) ≥1 time/week, and establish vocabulary expansion plans (≥20 domain-specific terms) based on feedback.",
    "Using social mirroring scaffolding (role model observation·imitation, peer feedback sharing), learners perform weekly language tasks (text structure analysis·writing·presentations) over 8 weeks, revise strategies reflecting ≥3 peer feedback points (clarity of expression·grammatical accuracy·logical flow), and reduce grammatical errors by ≥30% compared to pre-assessments.",
    "By the end of the 6-month course, learners demonstrate social awareness (active listening·empathic responses·role division) at ≥3 on a 4-point rubric scale during collaboration in ≥3 project-based assessments (team language presentations·role-plays·joint reports), while maintaining logical coherence (topic consistency·evidence provision·clarity of conclusions) in presentation content."
