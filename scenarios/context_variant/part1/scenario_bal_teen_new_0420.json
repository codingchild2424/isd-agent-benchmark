  "title": "Collaborative Learning Program for Developmental Nursing Care of Infants with Congenital Heart Disease Surgery: Enhancing Medical Communication and Professional Documentation Skills",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Fundamental nursing knowledge and basic understanding of cardiovascular anatomy, basic grammar for medical documentation (punctuation, medical terminology notation), and comprehension of specialized terminology (medical terms, abbreviations)",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Simulation/VR-based",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A blended curriculum combining VR simulations with BYOD-based activities in collaborative learning environments. Emphasizes field applicability through multidisciplinary approaches. Integrates training in medical documentation (diagnostic reports, nursing records), patient-family communication (empathetic expression), and language skills for team collaboration (medical terminology, situational communication styles).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "In a CICU environment, learners perform simulation scenarios applying pain management protocols with 90% accuracy, using professional medical terminology and grammatically correct sentence structures (subject-verb agreement, tense consistency) in nursing records.",
    "Collaborating with multidisciplinary team members, learners develop infant development nursing intervention plans in a VR-based environment, applying clear expression (medical terminology accuracy) and active listening skills (reflective listening) during inter-team communication.",
    "Learners apply family-centered nursing coordination strategies to actual cases, achieving over 80% participation rates and mastering explanatory skills to convey disease information effectively to patient families (simplification of medical terminology)."
