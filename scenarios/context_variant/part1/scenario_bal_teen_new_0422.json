    "Learners can utilize at least three AI image generation tools (e.g., Adobe Firefly, Bing Image Creator, Midjourney) to analyze and visualize the geometric structures (proportions, symmetry, patterns) of landscape design concepts using mathematical formulas (e.g., golden ratio, trigonometric functions).",
    "Learners can measure and calculate spatial components (area, volume, angles) of generated AI images and propose at least two actionable strategies for the design process (e.g., optimal space arrangement using coordinate systems, resource allocation planning applying proportional equations).",
    "Learners can develop prototypes (sketches, models, digital renderings) applicable to school landscape design projects (e.g., gardens, rest areas) using 3–5 images generated from experiential learning activities (e.g., nature observation, digital modeling) and utilize mathematical tools (coordinate systems, ratio calculations, equations) within 6 months."
