  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic public health knowledge and emergency response experience, intermediate+ reading/writing proficiency (text analysis, vocabulary inference, writing capability), and foundational understanding of situational expression training",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Capacity-building program for pre-service/in-service teachers to design disaster preparedness simulations applicable to language education (e.g., reading comprehension strategies, context-specific expression training, textual analysis). Implements context-embedded language learning through in-game text-based puzzles and role-play dialogues to maximize pedagogical impact.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "In a bioterrorism scenario-based escape game, learners can achieve an 80% or higher goal completion rate within 60 minutes using teamwork and problem-solving strategies, while enhancing their ability to decode encrypted clues through text analysis and vocabulary inference.",
    "Learners can explain three design principles of escape games combining digital tools (Quizlet, Google Forms, etc.) and physical puzzles (codebreaking, word combination), create one template applicable to vocabulary inference and contextual analysis activities, and achieve an \"Excellent\" grade in two or more of three peer evaluation criteria (creativity, feasibility, educational effectiveness).",
    "Through formative assessments, learners can meet team collaboration efficiency metrics (e.g., participation rate over 85%, number of idea contributions), present improvement plans based on oral/written feedback, and specify language-use strategies reflecting situational expression training."
