  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can master over 80% of core competencies for educational technology specialists (instructional design, project management, language learning theory application) and particularly understand grammar structure analysis and learner-customized vocabulary expansion strategies.",
    "Learners can analyze two or more stakeholder collaboration scenarios, propose practical applications for language education, and integrate text-based activity design with communication skill enhancement strategies (including role-play/debate activities).",
    "Learners can plan a 3–5 session language education project reflecting 21st-century skills (critical thinking, digital literacy), use Canva or Padlet to produce one lesson design document and two activity materials (e.g., digital posters, collaboration boards). Outputs must achieve an average of 4.0+ on peer evaluations (5-point scale), meet 80%+ of teacher feedback rubric criteria, and include text-based activity design, vocabulary expansion strategies (5+ items), and communication skill enhancement (role-play/debate activities)."
