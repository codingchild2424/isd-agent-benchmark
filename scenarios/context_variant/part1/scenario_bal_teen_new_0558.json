    "In a blended learning environment applying the scientific inquiry method (hypothesis–design–analysis–conclusion), learners perform eight core nursing competencies (e.g., medication management variable analysis, patient symptom evaluation, emergency response protocols) with ≥80% accuracy",
    "Learners engage in self-directed learning ≥2 times per week via mobile microlearning modules and record observations and evidence-based analyses (measured data, variable control methods, conclusion processes) in learning journals",
    "Over six months, learners participate in biweekly online discussions and monthly virtual simulations, achieving ≥4 average points (5-point scale) on a 5-level rubric (analysis, inference, application, evaluation, creation) based on peer evaluations (3 reviewers) and self-evaluation (1 session), thereby demonstrating critical thinking and clinical judgment skills"
