  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic soccer rules and techniques, team sports experience, foundational cooperative learning and leadership concepts, and introductory social relationship-building skills",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learners acquire training design methods reflecting real-game environments and focus on developing tactical adaptability across varying pitch sizes. Evaluates learning outcomes via real-time data analysis using digital devices, emphasizing role distribution within teams and social skill development. Compares historical sports strategy cases (e.g., 1970s Total Football) with modern applications, exploring cultural influences on team dynamics.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will select three offensive and two defensive tactics based on pitch sizes (small, medium, large) in soccer matches, achieve over 80% success rates in simulation games, and explain the tactical application process from the perspectives of social collaboration and civic role distribution.",
    "Explain the design method of conditional games for optimizing spatial utilization (width and depth) within a team from the perspectives of social relationships, cultural diversity, and role distribution.",
    "Develop tactical training tasks considering technical proficiency levels (beginner vs. intermediate) and learner characteristics, integrating team communication strategies and cultural inclusion strategies."
