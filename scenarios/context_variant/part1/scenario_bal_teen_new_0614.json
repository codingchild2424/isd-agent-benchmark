    "Learners can utilize appropriate mathematical registers (symbols, graphs, formulas) with over 80% accuracy when modeling real-life problems mathematically",
    "Through collaborative discussions with peers (online forums, group activities), learners can present at least three problem-solving strategies when resolving complex math problems",
    "Learners can explain mathematical reasoning processes through verbal and visual representations (text, sketches) and achieve peer or instructor feedback of at least 3 out of 4 points"
