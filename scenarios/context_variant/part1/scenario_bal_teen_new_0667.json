  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic geology and chemistry concepts, experience writing scientific reports, basic grammar and academic expression skills, and reading comprehension experience with diverse text types",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "An integrated activity applying scientific inquiry terminology and academic writing skills during digital-device-supported field research and data analysis projects. Designed to comprehensively enhance learners' reading comprehension, expressive skills, and critical thinking, with particular emphasis on effective language use in scientific contexts.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Students can apply core concepts of mineralogy, petrology, and geochemistry (MPG) within a project context, explaining them in the format of a scientific inquiry report while accurately utilizing academic vocabulary and grammatical structures.",
    "Through team-based investigative activities, students can analyze real geological samples, interpret data, and present findings in a structured text (introduction-methods-results-conclusion), demonstrating academic writing with logical flow and clear expression.",
    "Learners use digital tools (e.g., Google Docs, Canva) to create science lab reports and develop presentation materials that achieve an \"excellent\" rating in at least four out of five peer assessment rubric criteria (clarity, logic, vocabulary use, visual representation, validity of conclusions) during classroom presentations, applying academic expressions and effective communication strategies."
