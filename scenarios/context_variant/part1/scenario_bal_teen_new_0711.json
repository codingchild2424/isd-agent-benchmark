    "Analyze real classroom cases and categorize at least 3 instructional design strategies considering learner characteristics, environmental factors, and math content elements (equations, functions, statistics, proofs).",
    "Based on 3+ design insights gathered through group discussions (4 members), learners will create a math lesson plan including 2 problem-solving activities (formula calculation/application), 1 graph interpretation task (function/statistics), and 1 proof activity, and deliver a 10-minute presentation meeting at least 4 out of 5 rubric criteria.",
    "Achieve practical skills to iteratively improve an instructional design draft (visualizing calculation processes, formula application examples, graph analysis, proof explanations) at least twice through feedback incorporation."
