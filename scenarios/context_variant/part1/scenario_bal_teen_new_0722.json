  "title": "[K-12] Blended Learning-Based Teaching Methods Workshop for Cell Biology: Integrated Science Inquiry and Language Instruction Strategies",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational biology knowledge and teaching experience, understanding of scientific terminology (core vocabulary related to cell biology), and pedagogical expression skills (clear explanations, concept connections)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "An activity-based blended learning program for pre-service/in-service teachers to strengthen cell biology pedagogy, integrating scientific inquiry processes (observation-question-hypothesis-experiment-conclusion) with language learning (terminology acquisition, report writing, presentations). Emphasizes strategies to simultaneously develop learners' reading comprehension (scientific text analysis) and expressive skills (experimental result documentation).",

    "learner_age": "Teens (13-19)",
    "learner_education": "Elementary",
    "learner_role": "Pre-service/In-service teacher",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will systematically explain core concepts of cell structure and function using the scientific inquiry process (hypothesis-experiment-analysis-conclusion) and specialized terminology (cell membrane, mitochondria, chloroplast, etc.)",
    "Learners will design activity-based instructional methods in blended learning environments and creatively apply educational materials integrating learners’ reading/writing skills with scientific expressions (term definitions, lab report writing)",
    "Teachers will design and implement three instructional strategies (visualization tools, step-by-step experiments, feedback routines) within one week to help elementary/middle school students (teens) understand the scientific thinking process (hypothesis formulation-experiment analysis-conclusion), improving their concept comprehension scores (5-point scale) to 3.5 or higher. Special emphasis is placed on evaluating lab report writing (structured text, scientific vocabulary) and science terminology proficiency (accuracy/contextuality)"
