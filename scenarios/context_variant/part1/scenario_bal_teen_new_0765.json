  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Comprehension of basic scientific theories, computer literacy, intermediate or higher language proficiency (reading, writing, speaking, listening), understanding of basic grammatical structures, and experience in academic text interpretation",

    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Using computer models (e.g., simulation tools) to explain scientific phenomena, learners analyze the structure (introduction-body-conclusion) of three provided academic texts, compare model outputs with text vocabulary levels, and create a vocabulary difficulty assessment table with 80% accuracy. Special focus is placed on analyzing core concepts, connecting words, and academic vocabulary patterns within the texts.",
    "Learners design a modeling-based PBL project on a given language learning topic (e.g., environmental protection), execute it in three phases (problem definition–solution development–presentation), and achieve ≥80% attainment in at least four out of five evaluation criteria (creativity, feasibility, collaboration, expression, grammatical accuracy) through peer and instructor assessments. Oral clarity and logical structure are emphasized during presentations.",
    "Using computer models (e.g., ChatGPT, AI tutors), learners design three teaching strategies (reading activities, writing tasks, speaking exercises) tailored to elementary/middle school students’ (ages 10–15) language proficiency levels (beginner/intermediate/advanced). The strategies must reflect cognitive and language acquisition stages and achieve ≥80% suitability scores via peer evaluation and instructor verification."
