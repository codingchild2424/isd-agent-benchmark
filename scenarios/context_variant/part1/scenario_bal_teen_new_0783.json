  "title": "[K-12] Digital Twin-Based Language Project Learning Course: Integrated Improvement of Communication, Writing, and Expression Skills",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational digital tool utilization skills and elementary-level language proficiency (basic grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, expression). Understanding of basic writing structures and ability to perform simple text analysis",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Language practice (integrating speaking, listening, reading, writing) and project implementation in virtual-reality-linked environments using personal devices (BYOD). Includes activities such as role-playing in digital twin spaces, virtual interviews, and AR-based writing feedback. Strengthens writing skills through text generation, revision, and sharing during the learning process.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Enhance real-life communication skills (speaking/listening) and text analysis abilities (contextual understanding/vocabulary application) through language practice simulations in a digital twin environment",
    "Learners form project teams of 4–5 members to create one language learning content piece (including writing/expression elements) utilizing digital twin technologies (e.g., 3D virtual spaces, AR). They must achieve a total score of 80+ based on peer/teacher evaluation criteria (creativity 25%, functionality 25%, linguistic accuracy 30%, collaborative attitude 20%). The content includes assessment items for grammatical accuracy, lexical diversity, and expressive competence",
    "Learners receive personalized language proficiency diagnostic reports (including vocabulary/grammar/pronunciation/writing assessments) through formative evaluations (weekly quizzes, speaking recordings, writing sample analyses, etc.). Over a 6-month course, they achieve at least a two-level improvement (e.g., CEFR A1 → A2) in writing/speaking domains. Reports include detailed evaluations of reading, listening, and expressive skills"
