    "Students can systematically analyze the strengths and weaknesses of platforms by comparing core LMS features (customization, collaboration tools, assessment systems).",
    "Within 5 months, learner groups design science lesson plans based on 3+ themes (e.g., ecosystems, energy transition, space exploration) following science curriculum guidelines. Each lesson plan explicitly links 2 measurable learning objectives (e.g., \"Explain photosynthesis in 3 steps\") and 1 assessment method (e.g., lab report or quiz) in an instructional design portfolio.",
    "Students provide feedback on peers’ curriculum designs through peer review and submit improved instructional design proposals incorporating the feedback."
