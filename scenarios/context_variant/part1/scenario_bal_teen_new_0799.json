  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic medical/life science concepts, fundamental principles of emergency response, scientific inquiry methods (hypothesis formulation-experiment-analysis-conclusion), and foundational skills in designing controlled-variable experiments",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Integrates computer simulations (smartphone-accessible) with limited-environment mannequin practice. Aims to simultaneously enhance scientific reasoning (data interpretation, variable control) and clinical judgment (evidence-based decision-making). Stresses systematic inquiry (hypothesis-testing-experimentation-conclusion) using virtual patient data.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners observe virtual patients’ physiological variables (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.) in computer simulations with 80% or higher accuracy and make scientifically evidence-based diagnoses and appropriate interventions.",
    "Learners perform emergency response protocols with a 70% or higher success rate in mannequin simulations and systematically analyze and record experimental data (vital signs, response times, etc.).",
    "Learners compare the scientific validity (experimental design, data reliability) and educational effectiveness of two simulation methods to develop the ability to select optimal inquiry tools for learning contexts."
