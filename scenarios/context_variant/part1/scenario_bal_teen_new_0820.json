    "Develop the competency to analyze and summarize social science assignments using generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini).",
    "Learners will understand three ethical principles for generative AI use in blended learning environments (face-to-face/remote/flexible learning), such as source attribution, bias review, and personal information protection. They will create a checklist to evaluate the application of these principles in two real-world cases.",
    "Apply a process for critically evaluating and improving AI-generated content on LMS platforms."
