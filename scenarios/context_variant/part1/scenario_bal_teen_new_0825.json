  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can mathematically model fundamental bridge design principles and implement them using CAD tools.",
    "In teams of 4–5, learners will solve two real-world engineering problems (e.g., bridge design, solar power optimization) over three months using CPBL (collaborative problem-based learning). They will document the five-stage design process (problem definition → idea generation → prototyping → testing → improvement) and submit a final presentation meeting four or more out of five evaluation criteria.",
    "In a flipped learning environment, learners will demonstrate self-directed learning competencies by: 1) completing 80% or more of weekly learning videos, 2) scoring 70 or higher on online quizzes, and 3) fulfilling at least three items on a monthly self-assessment checklist. At course completion, they will submit a learning portfolio (error log, concept summaries) and achieve a rating of \"average\" or higher in three out of four teacher evaluation areas."
