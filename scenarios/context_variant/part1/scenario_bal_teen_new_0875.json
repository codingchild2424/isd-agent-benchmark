    "Learners must use three IMS LD-based social studies learning scenario templates to auto-generate a 3-step (design-review-revision) learning scenario for a Grade 5 social studies unit, submit results meeting ≥4 of 5 peer evaluation criteria (citizenship reflection, social issue analysis, cultural diversity consideration, etc.).",
    "Within one week, learners must use a social studies ontology (1 topic: cultural diversity, political systems, or economic systems) and provided content (3 texts, 5 images, 2 videos) to complete a 3-step E-Course draft (5 lessons) following: (1) E-Course proposal, (2) storyboard design, (3) peer feedback integration. The draft must enhance social problem-solving and civic engagement competencies."
