  "title": "[K-12] Scientific Inquiry and Linguistic Explanation Learning Design Based on Electrical Circuit Simulations",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic electrical circuit theory and comprehension of physical phenomena, recognition of scientific inquiry terminology (variables, hypotheses, evidence, etc.) and basic grammatical structures",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Simulation/VR-based",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Simulation-based integrated language-science curriculum conducted in a smartphone-centric, limited-technology environment. Learners explore electrical circuit principles through scientific inquiry terminology and diverse linguistic expressions (explanatory writing, data interpretation, logical reasoning), systematically acquiring complex concepts and enhancing writing skills via timely inquiry prompts and principle-based self-explanation.",

    "learner_education": "Middle school",
    "learner_role": "Student",
    "domain_expertise": "Beginner"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "In a simulation environment, learners will articulate core principles of electrical circuits (Ohm’s Law, series/parallel circuits) using scientific terminology and systematic linguistic structures (expository texts, logical connectors).",
    "Guided by timely inquiry questions, learners will manipulate experimental variables (resistance, voltage, current) and describe data analysis results with grammatical accuracy and clear vocabulary.",
    "Through principle-based self-explanation, learners will develop logical reasoning and systematic writing skills to connect simulation data with theoretical concepts.",
    "In a limited technological environment, learners can perform self-directed inquiry and combined learning integrating linguistic expression (reading comprehension, writing, logical explanation) using smartphone-based simulation tools."
