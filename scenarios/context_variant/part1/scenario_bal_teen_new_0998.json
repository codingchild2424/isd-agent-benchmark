  "title": "[K-12] Learning Design for Foreign Language Vocabulary/Cultural Understanding and Global Citizenship Development Using Educational Videos",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic foreign language grammar and reading comprehension, open attitude toward diverse cultures, experience with fundamental digital learning tools, and basic understanding of social interaction",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A foreign language vocabulary learning course via real-time video lectures in smartphone-limited environments. Measures learning outcomes through project-based assessments, emphasizing awareness of global citizenship rights (e.g., education, cultural respect) and responsibilities (e.g., environmental protection, diversity acceptance). Develops social relationship-building skills through collaborative activities (group discussions, joint projects) and includes practical tasks for community problem-solving.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Over four weeks, learners can accurately understand 200 essential foreign language vocabulary items in social contexts (e.g., daily conversations, formal events) and use appropriate expressions considering cultural differences.",
    "After watching educational videos, learners can achieve 80% or higher accuracy in vocabulary memorization through quizzes and acquire expressions necessary for building social relationships (e.g., gratitude, apologies, negotiations).",
    "Learners can apply 15 social/science vocabulary items (e.g., environmental protection, human rights, sustainability) from video content with 80% accuracy in two or more of three real-life situations (role-play, discussion, case analysis) and submit project deliverables that meet three or more of five multicultural understanding checklist items (communication, empathy, problem-solving, cultural sensitivity, collaboration)."
