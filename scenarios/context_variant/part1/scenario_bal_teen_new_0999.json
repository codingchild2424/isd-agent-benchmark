    "In teams of four, learners select one school/community issue (e.g., waste sorting efficiency, commute route safety), apply the five-stage design thinking process (empathize-define-ideate-prototype-test) to develop solutions including mathematical modeling (e.g., statistical analysis, optimization calculations), present the solution, and pass peer evaluation (at least two of three peers rate as \"excellent\") and teacher evaluation (three or more of five rubric items rated as \"superior\")."
