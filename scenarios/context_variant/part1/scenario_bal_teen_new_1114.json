    "Learners design one gamified cognitive activity plan for young children using game elements (points, levels, rewards) and submit a final product meeting ≥4 of 5 peer-reviewed and instructor feedback criteria (e.g., creativity, applicability, educational effectiveness).",
    "Learners solve ≥10 problems on a science quiz platform over 2 weeks, achieving ≥80% accuracy rate as the system dynamically adjusts difficulty levels (basic/intermediate/advanced) in real time.",
    "Develop digital learning modules that can be proposed to actual early childhood education institutions through project-based assessment",
