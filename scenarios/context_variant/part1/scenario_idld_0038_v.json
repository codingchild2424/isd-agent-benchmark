  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Completion of intermediate medical/clinical practicum or equivalent experience, basic patient diagnostic protocol understanding, standard treatment protocol (CPG) application experience, basic nursing skills mastery",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Students engage in self-directed learning and clinical expertise development via personal portfolios, with offline feedback sessions to assess learning outcomes. Activities include patient symptom documentation and treatment protocol analysis using personal devices (BYOD). The curriculum includes simulated EHR (Electronic Health Record) applications, patient safety case studies, and medical ethics scenario evaluations.",

    "Students will (1) analyze 3 patient diagnosis cases with clinical evidence (≥3 research papers), (2) conduct 1 medical research project (≥5 literature reviews), and (3) systematically compile 4 weekly reflective journals (≥500 characters each) in a portfolio. They will achieve ≥B grade (70–79%) in rubric items: ‘Clinical Evidence-Based Construction’ (≥7/10) and ‘Diagnostic Analysis Depth’ (≥7/10), including CPG application and nursing intervention planning.",
    "Students will synthesize feedback from 3 peers and 1 faculty member, derive 2 revised learning plans, submit improved plans within 2 weeks, and achieve ≥80% feedback incorporation. Feedback will be evaluated on patient safety enhancement, medical ethics compliance, and nursing intervention effectiveness analysis.",
    "Students will apply evaluation criteria for core competencies required of medical professionals (patient communication, clinical problem-solving, lifelong learning), with emphasis on patient-centered treatment planning, interdisciplinary team collaboration, and medical documentation skills."
