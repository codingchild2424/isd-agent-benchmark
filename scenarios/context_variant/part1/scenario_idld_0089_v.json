    "Learners can analyze a long jumper’s performance behaviors (execution, response, management) through three or more real-world case studies using representative learning design.",
    "Learners can design personalized training scenarios considering individual task constraints (physical, emotional, environmental) and achieve over 80% suitability scores through peer evaluation.",
    "Learners can compare the differences between maximum jump and partial jump strategies from cognitive and emotional perspectives and produce a 5-page report and presentation materials."
