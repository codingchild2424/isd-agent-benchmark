    "Learners can analyze linguistic expressions of scientific concepts (text structure, vocabulary usage) using AI-generated video preview features in PBL environments and produce project reports meeting ≥3.5 on a 5-point Likert-scale comprehension survey and ≥3 out of 4 rubric criteria (grammar accuracy, lexical diversity, logical organization, communicative effectiveness)",
    "Apply AI-based personalized feedback to improve PBL lesson design capabilities and learner communication strategies (questioning facilitation, feedback clarity, discussion promotion) by ≥80%",
    "Generate and evaluate ≥3 learner engagement strategies (open-ended questioning, reflective thinking facilitation, collaborative learning structuring) in science simulations, reviewing them from linguistic interaction perspectives (perspective expression, logical rebuttal, empathetic response)"
