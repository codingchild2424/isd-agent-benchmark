    "Propose integrating language learning elements (terminology definition, concept explanation, text analysis) into student-centered math textbook design principles (problem-solving, reasoning, representation).",
    "Develop ≥2 problem-solving activities (constructed-response questions, graphic organizers, concept mapping) considering students’ prior knowledge (basic math concepts and vocabulary levels).",
    "Learners collaborate with ≥3 peers in a VR simulation (e.g., ENGAGE platform) to complete language tasks (terminology explanation, diagram interpretation, argument construction), provide ≥3 structured peer feedbacks (praise-improvement-suggestion format), and design ≥2 scaffolded support stages (concept explanation → application problems).",
    "Create a rubric evaluating the balance between traditional instruction and student-centered approaches, including math concept understanding, linguistic expression, collaboration, and text interpretation."
