  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can explain the three dimensions and sub-elements of Biggs’ 3P Model (Presage-Process-Product) within the context of social constructivism and civic learning.",
    "Learners can systematically classify ten MOOC research cases using Template Analysis (TA) according to educational systems (five criteria), learner relationships (four criteria), and cultural influences (three criteria), and submit an analysis report presenting at least two evidence sources (e.g., policy documents, learner interviews) per category.",
    "Learners can analyze MOOC success factors (three learner attributes, three instructional designs, three performance metrics) in a VR simulation environment and write a critical evaluation report meeting at least four of five social interaction and civic engagement criteria (e.g., fairness, inclusivity, accessibility, transparency, accountability)."
