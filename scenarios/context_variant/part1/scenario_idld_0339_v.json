  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can explain at least three strategies for simultaneously applying PPK and PCK in real math class scenarios (e.g., error analysis in equation solving, graph interpretation activity design, probability concept visualization, geometric proof process reconstruction).",
    "Learners can design instructional plans for teaching math content (e.g., geometric proofs, statistical analysis, function graphs, probability distributions) that consider learners' cognitive developmental stages.",
    "Using GeoGebra or Desmos, learners can develop PPK-PCK integrated instructional materials (one interactive equation-solving module, one dynamic graph generator, one statistical simulation tool) and submit resources meeting at least two of three effectiveness feedback criteria from peer reviews and expert evaluations."
