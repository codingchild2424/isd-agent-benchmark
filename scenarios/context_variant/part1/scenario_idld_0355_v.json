  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic scientific experimental procedures (observation, hypothesis, variable control) and intermediate proficiency in digital tool utilization. Basic comprehension of experimental data measurement and analysis methods is required",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course strengthening competency in designing science education games based on gameplay loops within a smartphone-centric, limited technological environment. Focuses on enhancing scientific inquiry skills (measurement, analysis, conclusion-drawing) for elementary school students, emphasizing hands-on experience from experimental design to evidence collection and interpretation.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Develop elementary science experiment design scenarios using the 3-stage gameplay loop (goal-action-feedback) (e.g., scientific hypothesis → independent variable manipulation → dependent variable measurement → evidence analysis).",
    "Create a scientific inquiry design plan linking learning objectives (experiment design, data analysis, conclusion drawing) to game mechanics (points, levels, rewards) at ≥80% alignment.",
    "Build a smartphone-optimized prototype in Figma, simulate scientific conclusion-drawing processes through user feedback, and evaluate inquiry skills."
