  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Fundamental digital device proficiency, elementary science education experience, basic understanding of the scientific inquiry process (hypothesis formulation-experiment-observation-analysis-conclusion), and foundational knowledge of variable control and data interpretation",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Collaborative development of information search/evaluation/utilization skills for elementary teachers in science classes. Conducted in smartphone-centric limited-technology environments, emphasizing scientific literacy through experimental data interpretation, variable control, and evidence-based conclusions. Focuses on systematic application of scientific methodologies in observation recording, hypothesis testing, and data analysis.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "When designing science lessons, learners identify ≥3 credible digital sources (academic databases, government reports, peer-reviewed articles) and evaluate each source’s scientific validity and timeliness using experimental variables and evidence-based analysis methods.",
    "Through peer evaluation and feedback, determine the credibility of information sources with 80% accuracy, and analyze their association with hypothesis verification and experimental data (measurements, graphs, statistics). Particularly, assess the scientific rigor of variable control and conclusion derivation.",
    "Learners must complete a science lesson information package (covering one topic with at least three types of materials) within five days using smartphone apps (e.g., Canva, Google Workspace) and web tools (e.g., ThingLink, Padlet). The submission must meet at least six of the eight institutional checklist criteria. The package should include experimental design, data visualization, and evidence-based conclusion elements that support the scientific inquiry process (observation-hypothesis-experiment-analysis-conclusion)."
