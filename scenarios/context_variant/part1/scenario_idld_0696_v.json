    "Learners design lightweight deep learning models for image classification or speech recognition using TensorFlow Lite or ONNX Runtime on resource-constrained devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi 4, Jetson Nano: 4-core CPU, ≤4GB RAM) and validate a system achieving real-time performance (>30FPS) with inference latency <100ms.",
    "Learners will develop an FPGA-based deep learning system prototype through a team project consisting of four members and submit deliverables meeting the following criteria at the end of the six-month course: 1) Achieve inference accuracy of 85% or higher on the MNIST or CIFAR-10 dataset, 2) Utilize FPGA resources at 70% or higher efficiency, 3) Prepare a 15-page technical report (including methodology, experimental results, and limitations)."
