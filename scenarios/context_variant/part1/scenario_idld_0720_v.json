    "Systematically explore academic resources related to mathematics education topics (e.g., polynomial equation-solving strategies, probability distribution interpretation) using the ICE framework (Idea-Connection-Extension), analyzing graphs and statistical models.",
    "Through collaborative learning, propose ≥2 critical evaluation criteria for academic information validity (e.g., proof feasibility of formulas, derivation processes) and reliability (e.g., data source transparency, sample size adequacy).",
    "Explain a 4+ step research design process (topic selection-variable setting-data collection-statistical analysis) using academic library digital resources (mathematics databases, e-journals)."
