    "Using the MIRACLE framework’s six stages (problem definition, information gathering, solution derivation, action planning, evaluation, improvement), learners complete a science experiment report project. They achieve an average of 4+/5 points in peer evaluations (3+ evaluators) and mentor feedback across criteria: communication clarity, logical coherence, and collaborative attitude."
