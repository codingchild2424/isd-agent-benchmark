Learners assume roles as administrators/leaders, possessing advanced domain expertise and social relationship management skills. The goal is to foster citizen participation and a collaborative culture within educational institutions, particularly recommending project-based learning (PBL) linked to solving local community issues.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can design gamification elements (experience points, badges, leaderboards, etc.) to propose a social motivation strategy maintaining learner engagement over 20% for a 14-week course, including institutional mechanisms for respecting rights and building collaborative relationships among learners.",
    "Learners can identify the timing of gamification effectiveness decline by analyzing weekly behavioral engagement data and propose three or more social relationship enhancement techniques (collaborative learning, role division, reward sharing), including mandatory community consciousness plans for civic development.",
    "Learners can write an engineering education prototype design document using mobile game design techniques (quest systems, dynamic rewards, etc.), incorporating three or more interaction mechanisms (e.g., peer assessment, group missions) and two or more community-building strategies (e.g., virtual discussion forums, shared journals). The design passes if it meets four or more of five corporate evaluation rubric items (functionality, creativity, feasibility), with mandatory inclusion of a social responsibility criterion."
