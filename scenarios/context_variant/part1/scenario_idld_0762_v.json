    "Learners will use blended feedback (automated scoring system + peer evaluation) to perform customized language expression improvements and grammar error corrections at least twice weekly, strengthening self-directed learning abilities through feedback implementation",
    "Over a 1–6-month long-term course, learners will select two tasks (writing, presentation, discussion), establish personalized language learning plans using variable deadlines (extendable up to 2 weeks per task), submit at least 8 of 10 weekly learning logs, and demonstrate planning execution by achieving over 80% (4 of 5) on the final portfolio rubric criteria (grammar accuracy, vocabulary diversity, fluency, logical structure, creativity)"
