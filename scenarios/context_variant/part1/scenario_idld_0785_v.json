    "Learners can accurately interpret five or more pathogenic variants in patient samples using three or more clinical bioinformatics tools (e.g., CLC Genomics Workbench, GATK) according to genomic testing protocols (e.g., Whole Exome Sequencing) and classify them into three of five ACMG categories (Pathogenic, Likely Pathogenic, VUS).",
    "Learners can classify ten or more genetic variants into five categories (Pathogenic, Likely Pathogenic, VUS, Likely Benign, Benign) based on ACMG criteria and develop counseling strategies including three core elements (genetic counseling ethics, result interpretation, emotional support) for each case.",
    "Learners can analyze ten real genomic case datasets over six months, apply a five-step evidence-based genomic counseling protocol (data interpretation, literature review, risk assessment, counseling strategy development, patient education), and write counseling reports with 80%+ accuracy."
