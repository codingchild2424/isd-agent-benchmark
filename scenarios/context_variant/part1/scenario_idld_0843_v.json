    "Over a 2–4 week mid-term course, learners solve ten or more complex mathematical problems in engineering calculations and statistical modeling provided by vocational training institutions. Using analytical (problem decomposition, pattern identification) and integrative (multiconcept connection) approaches, they document step-by-step solutions meeting four or more of five criteria in a scientific reasoning rubric (logical consistency, evidence, error analysis, computational accuracy, interpretation).",
