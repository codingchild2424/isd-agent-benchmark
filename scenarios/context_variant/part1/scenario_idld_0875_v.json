  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic translation theory and scientific field-specific terminology (life science laboratory terms: microscopy, cell culture, PCR analysis; research methodologies: control group design, random sampling; data analysis expressions: standard deviation, significance level (p-value))",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Conducted in smartphone-based learning environments, emphasizing applicability to the work of current science translators. Focuses on translating core elements of scientific texts: experimental procedures (variable control, measurement methods), data analysis (statistical processing, graph interpretation), and hypothesis verification (evidence collection, conclusion drawing). Includes mobile CAT tools and real-time collaboration scenarios.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Utilize basic functions of CAT tools (Trados, MemoQ) with over 80% accuracy for scientific text translation, and accurately translate experimental procedures (variable control, measurement methods) and hypothesis verification (evidence collection, conclusion derivation) content in life sciences papers.",
    "Perform translation collaboration processes (shared documents, real-time feedback) in mobile environments at least three times and evaluate scientific accuracy and consistency of evidence-based expressions (data visualization, analysis results) through peer review.",
    "Learners translate three life sciences papers within a week, maintain consistency for over 20 key terms (experimental tools, analysis techniques) using a glossary, and submit translations meeting at least four of five quality-checklist items (terminology accuracy, sentence structure, data representation, hypothesis description, conclusion consistency) via peer review.",
    "Learners establish and execute a self-directed learning plan in a blended learning environment, utilizing online lectures (3 sessions/week, 60 minutes/session) and offline workshops (2 sessions/week, 90 minutes/session) for translation skill development within a week. The plan specifies time allocation (60% online: 180 minutes, 40% offline: 180 minutes) and weekly goals (85% translation accuracy). Additionally, they submit a weekly learning journal (2,000 characters) and two translation assignments (1 experimental report: 500 words, 1 research abstract: 300 words), with accuracy measured by certified tools (e.g., BLEU Score), emphasizing experimental observations, graph interpretation, and research conclusion summaries."
