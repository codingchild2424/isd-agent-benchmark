    "Learners are evaluated on algorithm design capabilities for problem-solving in robot programming (achieving over 80% performance)",
    "Learners will connect three everyday problems in healthcare/nursing (e.g., patient mobility assistance, reducing medication distribution errors) with robotics principles (sensor utilization, automation processes) and create a portfolio according to a constructivist learning model (problem-solving projects, reflective journaling). The portfolio must meet at least four of the five evaluation rubric items.",
    "Over a 6-month course, learners will perform computational thinking-based projects (e.g., autonomous robot design) and submit team-based results applying at least three interdisciplinary problem-solving strategies (e.g., medical data analysis, robot control algorithm design, ethical considerations integration). They must achieve over 80% scores in at least three of the four institutional rubric items (problem definition clarity, technical implementation completeness, creativity, team collaboration) to pass."
