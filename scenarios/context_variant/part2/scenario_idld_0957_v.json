    "Learners plan one mathematics project themed on local community issues (e.g., optimizing waste sorting efficiency, improving public facility accessibility), generate at least three types of data visualizations (graphs/charts) using Python or Scratch, and deliver a 5-minute presentation appropriately using purpose-specific language (descriptive, explanatory, persuasive) for each stage: problem definition, solution proposal, and result analysis.",
    "Learners document cases where they apply at least five mathematical terms (e.g., algorithm complexity, binary search, matrix operations) acquired through service-learning to real IT work scenarios (e.g., code optimization, data analysis, system design). They create a portfolio meeting three evaluation criteria: clarity, practicality, and creativity."
