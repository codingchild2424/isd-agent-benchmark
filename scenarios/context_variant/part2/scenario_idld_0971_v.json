    "Students can accurately derive language problem-solving strategies from pre-class materials provided in a flipped learning environment with over 80% accuracy.",
    "Students successfully collaborate with team members to solve authentic language-related problems in a VR simulation environment at least three times.",
    "Students can specifically describe three or more impacts of flipped learning on their learning motivation and language proficiency through reflective journals."
