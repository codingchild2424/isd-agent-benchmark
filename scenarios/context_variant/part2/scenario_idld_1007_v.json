    "Learners can create TVET project proposals by applying Fourth Industrial Revolution core technologies (AI, IoT, etc.) and scientific inquiry methods (hypothesis formulation–experimentation–analysis–conclusion)",
    "Using simulation tools reflecting industry requirements, learners can solve technical problems following a scientific inquiry process (hypothesis formulation → variable control → data measurement → analysis → evidence-based conclusion derivation)",
    "Learners select three or more practice-centered projects completed during a 1–6 month long-term course, systematically organize them according to a portfolio template (cover page, project overview, process/results visualization, self-assessment), and receive feedback through peer evaluation (3 reviewers) and instructor evaluation (4/5 rubric points or higher). Particularly, variable control capabilities and evidence-based conclusion derivation skills based on experimental data are assessed in each project"
