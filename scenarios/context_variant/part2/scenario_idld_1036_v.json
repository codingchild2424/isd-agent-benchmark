  "learning_goals": [
    "By the end of the 1-week course, learners explain five core scientific concepts required in vocational settings (e.g., thermodynamics laws, electrical circuit analysis, chemical reaction calculations) using scientific inquiry methods, design experiments with variables for three work-related scenarios, and demonstrate evidence-based conclusions through a summative exam (70%+ score) and practical assignment (3+ points/5 on rubric)",
    "Learners conduct self-directed inquiry learning on web-based platforms to perform measurement data analysis, hypothesis verification, experimental procedure review, and advanced research",
    "Learners collaborate with two peers using real-time tools (Figma/Miro) to complete a 3-phase (proposal-experiment-report) science experiment design project using recycled materials, achieving 4+ points out of 5 on the evaluation rubric"
