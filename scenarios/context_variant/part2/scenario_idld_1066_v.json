    "Learners will calculate mathematical problems (3 ratio, 2 area, 1 volume) occurring during the restoration of two historical artifacts using 3D simulation tools (Blender or Unity), derive results within a 5% error margin, and submit a report.",
    "Learners will complete one digital portfolio documenting a mathematical modeling process (problem definition, variable setting, simulation) step-by-step on an LMS (Moodle or Google Classroom) using tablets/laptops in a collaborative learning environment within a week. After sharing with team members and receiving ≥3 feedbacks, they must achieve ≥4/5 in four of five peer evaluation rubric items."
