  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Expert-level speech-language pathology knowledge (language development, disorder diagnosis, therapy techniques), complex problem-solving experience, basic clinical psychology understanding, and foundational linguistic analysis (phonetics, semantics, pragmatics)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",

    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A competency-enhancement program for pre-service or in-service language psycholinguistic therapy teachers. Conducted asynchronously online in a smartphone-based limited technological environment. Focuses on improving linguistic analysis (text interpretation, discourse analysis) and treatment-planning skills, with emphasis on assessing expressive/receptive language abilities in children with language disorders.",

    "Learners analyze the principles and application cases of VRE (Virtual Reality Environment) to explain its potential in language psychotherapy education and evaluate changes in patients’ linguistic expressions using scientific inquiry methods.",
    "Learners practice exposure therapy procedures using VRE simulation content provided via a mobile LMS and develop the ability to systematically observe changes in patients’ linguistic expressions (pronunciation, vocabulary, sentence structure).",
    "Learners understand real clinical contexts through case-based learning materials and enhance their ability to apply linguistic interaction strategies (questioning techniques, empathetic responses, clarification requests) when establishing VRE treatment plans."
