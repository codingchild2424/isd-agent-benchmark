  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can address real-world biotechnology issues (e.g., societal impacts of gene-editing technology) through a challenge-based approach, conducting comprehensive analyses that consider civic rights and cultural contexts",
    "Learners can design data-driven decision-making processes using digital tools, incorporating the economic, political, and institutional contexts of biotechnology and proposing directions for systemic improvement",
    "In 4-member teams, learners analyze one real-world biotechnology case (e.g., issues in applying gene-editing technology) and propose actionable creative solutions through a three-stage collaborative process: brainstorming → prototype design → solution presentation. They must achieve over 80 points on the evaluation rubric (Creativity 30%, Collaboration Efficiency 30%, Feasibility 40%). This process includes a holistic analysis of the technology’s ethical/social impacts and historical case comparisons"
