    "In an Airbnb accommodation price prediction case study, learners can analyze over ten data variables, implement linear regression and decision tree models using Python's scikit-learn, compare RMSE and R² scores between models, and describe three key insights (e.g., price influencing factors, model performance differences, variable importance) within 500 characters: conduct comparative analysis and statistical significance testing to derive evidence-based conclusions.",
    "Within three weeks, learners can tune five hyperparameters (number of trees, max depth, min samples split, etc.) of a random forest regression model in a Python-based simulation environment (Jupyter Notebook) via grid search or Bayesian optimization, compare performance metrics (R², RMSE) of the optimized model against the baseline using scientific methodology (hypothesis-experiment-analysis), and submit a report showing ≥10% improvement: quantitatively evaluate model enhancement effects and document reproducible research processes."
