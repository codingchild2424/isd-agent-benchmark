  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic computer literacy, vocational core competencies, foundational grammar and vocabulary for business document creation, and collaborative experience using digital tools",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Problem-solving projects in digital mobile environments cultivate software application skills for real-world use and precise language expression (grammatical accuracy, lexical appropriateness, contextual relevance) aligned with job contexts. Project outputs must adhere to technical documentation standards (clarity, conciseness, purpose, logical structure), with peer feedback and self-assessment enhancing expressive and reading skills.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can solve PBL-based problems rooted in real job scenarios, achieving over 80% proficiency in practical spreadsheet/presentation tool skills and technical documentation/presentation abilities (grammar accuracy, vocabulary appropriateness, logical structuring).",
    "Learners can verify self-directed learning competencies throughout the planning→execution→evaluation process using SRL strategies and enhance metacognition via reflective journaling (documenting learning processes, analyzing errors, establishing improvement strategies).",
    "Learners, in teams of 3–4, can complete a digital collaboration project (e.g., virtual event proposal) within a week using Google Workspace (Docs, Sheets, Meet) or Notion, submit a collaboration process report including role distribution and feedback records, and achieve an average score of 4+ out of 5 in peer evaluations for communication skills (clear expression, active listening) and document clarity (grammar accuracy, vocabulary appropriateness, logical consistency)."
