    "Learners can communicate effectively with team members using virtual collaboration tools (e.g., Google Workspace)",
    "In a 4-week experiential project, learners take one role (developer, tester, planner) in a virtual team (4–6 members). They collaborate to document three key decisions (tech stack selection, schedule adjustments, issue resolution) in meeting minutes/shared documents and submit a 5-page team report on time. The report must meet: 1) clarity of decision rationale, 2) explicit role contributions, 3) progress analysis vs. project schedule.",
    "Analyzing formative assessment feedback (code reviews, team meeting records) over two weeks, learners establish three action plans (e.g., issue tracking tool adoption, daily stand-up meeting improvements, role clarification) to enhance collaboration processes and reach consensus with teammates."
