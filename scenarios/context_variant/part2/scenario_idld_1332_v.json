  "learning_goals": [
    "Students will utilize AR technology to replicate five fundamental physical movements (e.g., push-ups, squats, jumps) with 80% accuracy and integrate social interaction elements (teamwork, leadership, civic consciousness) during the exercise process.",
    "Learners will analyze their exercise posture in real-time via an AR feedback system and identify at least three improvement points considering physical characteristics (strength, flexibility) and social requirements (collaboration, consideration, accessibility).",
    "Learners, organized into teams of four, will develop one AR-based physical education scenario to enhance the exercise capabilities of learners with special needs (visual impairment, physical disabilities, etc.), create a 5-minute presentation and demonstration video reflecting social inclusivity (fairness, civic rights) and technical completeness, and achieve over 70 points based on the final evaluation criteria (scenario social value 20% + completeness 20%, technical implementation 30%, presentation effectiveness 20%, inclusivity evaluation 10%)."
