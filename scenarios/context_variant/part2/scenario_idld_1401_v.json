  "learning_goals": [
    "Identify and explain at least three spatial design elements suitable for the cognitive development stages of early childhood (sensorimotor and preoperational stages), incorporating scientific inquiry components (observation, experimentation, hypothesis formation, variable control).",
    "Design interactive exhibition elements (adjustable variable manipulation, evidence-gathering activities, data analysis) using VR simulation tools to stimulate exploratory behaviors in young children.",
    "Within four weeks, learners analyze three design trends, two literary works, and one cognitive development study to complete a theme-based museum space design project (including floor plans, 3D modeling, and explanatory materials) reflecting the scientific inquiry process (experimental design, measurement, analysis, conclusion). They achieve over 80% in four out of five expert evaluation rubric criteria."
