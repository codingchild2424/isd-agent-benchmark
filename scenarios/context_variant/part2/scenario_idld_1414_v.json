    "Learners can design two 3D models or circuit prototypes reflecting the historical development of healthcare/nursing using digital fabrication tools (e.g., Tinkercad, Fusion 360, Eagle) and achieve an average score of 80 or higher across functionality (40%), historical accuracy (30%), and creativity (30%) based on expert evaluation criteria.",
    "Learners can design problem-solving solutions in a healthcare-technology convergence project (e.g., digital healthcare solution development) using three or more critical thinking techniques (e.g., SWOT analysis, 5Why analysis) and two or more computational thinking tools (e.g., algorithm design, data visualization) and achieve a grade of B or higher in four out of five project evaluation rubric items."
