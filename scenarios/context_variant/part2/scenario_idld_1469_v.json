    "Learners can lead a large-scale online design study with 10+ participants using LMS-based collaboration tools (e.g., Google Workspace, Microsoft Teams), achieve a weekly learning goal completion rate of 80% or higher over four weeks, and receive a participant satisfaction survey score of 4.0/5.0 or higher.",
    "Learners can create two visualization prototypes based on customer interaction scenarios using smartphone-optimized tools like Figma or Adobe XD, incorporate feedback from peers/instructors (5+ items), and submit an improved version reflecting 80% or more of the feedback.",
    "Learners can reconstruct design research outcomes into teachable materials applicable to educational settings"
