    "Learners can analyze sensitive design cases and apply ethical decision-making frameworks.",
    "Learners enhance their ability to integrate subjective experiences and objective criteria to solve real-life design problems.",
    "Learners can identify three or more ethical conflict situations (e.g., privacy protection, treatment priority, family consent procedures) that may arise when designing digital tools for children with cancer treatment and propose two or more solutions (e.g., anonymization techniques, multidisciplinary committee formation) grounded in ethical frameworks (e.g., Declaration of Helsinki) for each situation."
