  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Comprehension of basic geometric concepts (shapes, measurement, spatial relationships) and intermediate-level application skills. Requires foundational ability to translate mathematical expressions into verbal/textual descriptions. Experience in linking visual materials (graphs, diagrams) to linguistic explanations",

    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Training program for pre-service teachers on geometry pedagogy integrated with language instruction. Focuses on systematizing mathematical concepts through linguistic expression (text/oral explanations) and cultivating explanatory skills using visual aids (adding verbal annotations, interpreting diagrams). Emphasizes improving learners' reading comprehension (text-visual integration) and expressive abilities (verbalizing modeling processes).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can analyze three real-world geometry problems (e.g., building design, map creation, product design) using GeoGebra and Desmos, systematize step-by-step solutions reflecting mathematical modeling (equations/graphs) and spatial reasoning into instructional design plans with linguistic expressions (text/diagram explanations) within one week. Each plan must achieve over 80% on the rubric (problem analysis 25%, modeling accuracy 30%, spatial reasoning application 25%, clarity of linguistic explanation 20%).",
    "Learners can develop one mathematics lesson material inducing higher-order thinking (analysis/evaluation/creation) by applying three RME (Realistic Mathematics Education) principles (e.g., real-world context linkage, social interaction, modeling) and submit outcomes meeting four or more of five peer evaluation rubric items (problem definition clarity, modeling appropriateness, argument structure, linguistic expression, visual aids). (Emphasis on verbalization of abstract concepts and argument structure design)",
    "Learners can apply a three-phase or more interactive geometry learning module design process (requirements analysis → content prototyping → user testing → optimization) in a mobile microlearning environment (5-minute modules) and submit designs achieving over 4 points (5-point scale) in two or more of three corporate evaluation rubric items (functionality, interactivity, learning effectiveness). (Emphasis on visual-linguistic interaction design and multimedia text integration)"
