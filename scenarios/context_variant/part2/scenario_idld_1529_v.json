  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Intermediate-level knowledge and practical experience in the field. Requires foundational grammar comprehension, text analysis skills, and experience with digital tools. Additionally, proficiency in diverse language modalities (speaking, writing, listening) and basic reflective thinking competencies",

    "additional_context": "A project-based course where graduate students design language education for middle schoolers. Focuses on building effective learning environments by combining digital tools and reflective practice. Aims to improve learners' reading comprehension, expression, and collaboration skills, encouraging activity design using diverse language materials (text, audio, visual). Especially emphasizes learning design integrating grammatical accuracy, vocabulary expansion, and creative expression.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Graduate students will design three language learning activities (vocabulary quizzes, collaborative writing, feedback sharing) using digital tools like Kahoot!, Padlet, and Google Docs, and submit activity designs within three weeks that score 4+ points (on a 5-point scale) in peer and instructor evaluations (clarity, interactivity, learning effectiveness).",
    "Learners will apply the three-stage Reflective Practice framework (Observe-Reflect-Improve) to write two or more evaluation and improvement reports during the learning design process and revise the final design based on peer/instructor feedback.",
    "Learners will revise and develop a language learning design prototype twice or more by reflecting on three or more peer feedbacks and achieve a 'B+' or higher in four of five peer evaluation rubric items (grammatical accuracy, creativity, interactivity, learning effectiveness, visual organization) for the final output.",
    "Learners will select three or more OpenCourseWare (OCW) resources and two or more language learning apps, analyze each resource’s educational strengths and limitations, and create one or more language learning designs that meet at least two of three rubric criteria (content relevance, technology utilization, creativity)."
