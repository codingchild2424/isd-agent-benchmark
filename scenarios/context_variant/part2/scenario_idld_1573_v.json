    "Learners will diagnose misconceptions in cardiovascular physiology with ≥80% accuracy and apply these to organizational knowledge-sharing processes.",
    "Learners will improve metacognitive awareness of their knowledge levels by ≥50% through multi-stage assessments and perform self-reflection using peer feedback systems.",
    "In a 4-week project-based assessment, learners will analyze ≥2/3 presented misconceptions (e.g., workflow misunderstandings, data interpretation errors, communication biases) applied to real work scenarios (meetings, reports, decisions) and receive ≥4/5 points in \"applicability\" from ≥2/3 supervisors/peers. Additionally, cultural diversity considerations will be incorporated into team collaboration."
