  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can reproduce definitions, formulaic expressions, and graph interpretations of 50 math-specific terms (geometry, algebra, statistics) with ≥90% accuracy using digital flashcards and video-enhanced materials.",
    "Learners can plan, execute, and evaluate math vocabulary learning processes with ≥80% engagement using self-regulated learning strategies (SRLM), deepening conceptual understanding of equations and statistical reasoning through error analysis.",
    "Learners can reflect differentiated strategies for applying digital learning tools (interactive graphs, virtual manipulatives) based on pre-existing vocabulary knowledge (PVK) in project deliverables (mathematical modeling cases and proof processes)."
