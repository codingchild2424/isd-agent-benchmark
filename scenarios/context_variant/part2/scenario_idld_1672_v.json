Continuous monitoring of learning progress through formative assessments, emphasizing scientifically applicable knowledge (variable control, evidence-based conclusions, scientific inquiry processes). In healthcare, focus is on clinical data analysis and scientific approaches to symptom observation; in law, on scientific evidence evaluation and experimental reproducibility reviews; in technology, on engineering problem-solving and experimental design optimization.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will use a flipped learning model to complete ≥80% of pre-learning materials (e.g., scientific theories, experimental protocols, variable control methods) ≥2 times weekly. They will apply scientific inquiry principles when formulating hypotheses.",
    "Learners will collaboratively develop and present ≥3 problem-solving strategies based on the scientific inquiry process (hypothesis → experiment design → data collection → analysis). They will specify measurement tools and analytical techniques for each stage.",
    "Learners will maintain ≥90% participation in formative assessments and write self-reflective learning logs including experimental observations, variable analyses, and evidence-based conclusions. Logs must systematically document data collection and logical reasoning.",
    "Graduate learners will apply data analysis techniques, experimental design principles, and evidence-based conclusion methods acquired in a flipped learning environment to write one case study linked to an actual research project or technical report. The case study must achieve ≥4/5 (\"excellent\") in ≥4 of 5 peer/mentor evaluation categories (relevance, creativity, practicality, logic, completeness) within 6 months. Scientific methodology and experimental reproducibility must be validated."
