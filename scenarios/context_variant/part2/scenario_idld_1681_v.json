  "title": "Self-Directed Language Education Workshop for Understanding Differences Between Case-Based Learning (CBL) and Problem-Based Learning (PBL): Focused on Text Analysis and Expression Strategies",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Expert-level language education knowledge, experience solving complex linguistic problems, basic grammar and text analysis skills, and understanding of diverse linguistic expression techniques",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learners primarily use smartphones or tablets, with limited PC-based learning. The focus is on pedagogical methods applicable to language education (integrated reading-writing, vocabulary expansion, and communication skills enhancement), emphasizing text-based activities executable on low-spec devices. Case studies and writing activities utilizing diverse text types—such as news articles, literary works, and academic papers—are included.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Explain at least three key differences between CBL and PBL: (actual case text analysis vs. problem-solving inquiry, structured reading materials vs. open-ended questioning, reflective reading emphasis vs. creative expression promotion).",
    "Present at least two criteria for selecting appropriate teaching methods suited to language education contexts (grammar structure analysis, vocabulary expansion, communication skill enhancement), considering learning objective types (reading/writing/expression), learner proficiency levels (beginner/intermediate/advanced), and technological constraints (offline/low-spec devices).",
    "Within a six-month course, learners design CBL/PBL activities executable on low-spec devices and offline environments (three text-based case studies: newspaper articles/literary works/academic papers, two low-tech writing tasks: reflective journals/creative reconstructions). They must achieve an average score of 4/5 or higher in peer evaluations (three evaluators) and over 80% suitability in expert reviews."
