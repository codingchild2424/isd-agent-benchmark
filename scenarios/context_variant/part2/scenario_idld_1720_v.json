    "Incorporating peer feedback three or more times, learners create a 5-minute explanatory video on a math concept (e.g., derivatives, integrals, matrices), upload it to a sharing platform, and receive a rating of 4 or higher (5-point scale) in \"clarity\" and \"accuracy\" from at least two peers.",
    "Learners analyze their role changes in three aspects (participation, contribution, leadership) within a learning community over one week, write a 500-character self-assessment report, and submit it with at least two clear examples."
