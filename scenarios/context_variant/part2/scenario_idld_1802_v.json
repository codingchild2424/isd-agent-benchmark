    "Learners explain electrical engineering experiment results in a 3-minute structured English presentation within VR simulations, incorporating variable control and evidence-based analysis",
    "Learners write self-assessment reports reflecting peer feedback and experimental data, improving scientific English speaking proficiency (presentation structure, technical term accuracy) by ≥20%",
    "Learners achieve scientific English fluency (1.5 seconds/word) equivalent to face-to-face classes in online settings through Gagné’s nine instructional events (hypothesis setting → experiment design → data analysis → conclusion)"
