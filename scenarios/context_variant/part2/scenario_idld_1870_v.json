Additionally, learners must include concrete examples applying both methodologies to actual AI experiment designs (e.g., hyperparameter tuning, resource allocation)",
    "Within 2–4 weeks, learners design an optimal capacity exploration process for a given AI system (e.g., recommendation algorithm) satisfying safety (risk score ≤ 0.3) and efficiency (processing speed ≥ 100ms) constraints, validate it 3+ times in a simulation environment, and achieve an average performance score of 85+ points"
