    "Learners conduct collaborative problem-solving activities using specialized terminology and academic expressions in health sciences at least three times in online discussion forums, applying community learning principles",
    "Learners provide at least two peer feedbacks in VR-based simulation environments using specialized medical terminology and structured expressions through health science case studies, evaluating feedback clarity and logical coherence",
    "Learners analyze their participation patterns (degree centrality, betweenness centrality, etc.) using learner network analysis tools like Gephi or NodeXL across three metrics, and create implementation plans including at least three action items (e.g., vocabulary diversification, sentence structure improvement) to enhance communication efficiency"
