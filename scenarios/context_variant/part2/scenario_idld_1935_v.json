    "Learners can descriptively document the process of designing science experiments and verifying hypotheses in a virtual laboratory.",
    "In a virtual environment-based assessment simulation (e.g., Labster, VR science labs), learners perform three scientific inquiry activities (observation, hypothesis formation, experimental design). They achieve an average of 4 or higher on a 5-point rubric per activity and write a quantitative results report (including data visualization).",
    "Learners can enhance academic language proficiency in accurately explaining scientific terminology and experimental procedures."
