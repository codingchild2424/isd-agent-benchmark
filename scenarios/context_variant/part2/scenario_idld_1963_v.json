    "Design three game-based learning (GBL) activities effective for explaining chemical concepts, with each activity reflecting the scientific inquiry process (hypothesis setting–experiment–analysis–conclusion).",
    "Compare two instructional strategies (variable control strategy, evidence-based feedback strategy) for enhancing cognitive and motivational effects when applying GBL.",
    "Learners develop a one-week short-term lesson plan including three mobile-compatible quizzes (balancing chemical equations, periodic table puzzle, molecular structure assembly) and one science simulation (virtual experiment: measuring chemical reaction rates), and submit a lesson design document achieving at least 4 points per item (total ≥9/12) based on an in-house evaluation rubric (Content Suitability, Technical Accessibility, Learning Effectiveness).",
    "Through project-based assessment, learners develop and present a GBL chemistry lesson model, demonstrating its scientific validity and educational effectiveness."
