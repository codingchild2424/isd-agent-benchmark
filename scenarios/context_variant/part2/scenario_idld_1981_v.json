    "Upon completing the 6-month course, learners will compile language knowledge acquired during projects (e.g., 150 specialized vocabulary items, 20 grammar rules) into structured learning journals (weekly entries, 24 total) and collaborative reports (1 per team), and present them for peer evaluation (≥3 feedbacks) and orientation sessions for subsequent learners"
