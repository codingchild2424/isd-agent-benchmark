  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners explain core elements of basketball tactics through segmented videos (macro/micro segments) by combining linguistic descriptions (terminology, instructions) with visual aids at 80% accuracy.",
    "Learners achieve a game performance assessment score of 75 or higher (out of 100) in morning learning sessions and accurately use tactical vocabulary (e.g., 'screen', 'cut', 'pass') during evaluations.",
    "During the mid-course (weeks 2–4), learners apply three language expressions related to basketball tactics (e.g., 'positioning', 'teamwork', 'strategy') weekly via formative assessments and incorporate over 80% of evaluator feedback into the next week's practice."
