    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can derive problem-solving solutions based on the scientific inquiry process by utilizing real-time collaboration tools with peers.",
    "Learners enhance their self-reflection skills based on peer feedback through formative assessments during collaborative activities and systematically analyze experimental variables and hypothesis verification processes.",
    "Learners can select three collaborative learning strategies (role division, feedback routines, resource-sharing protocols) in a limited technological environment (e.g., offline meetings, basic messengers) and, with a team of five members, complete a 2-hour practical task (e.g., virtual experiment data analysis) while achieving over 70% of the execution checklist for each strategy."
