    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learners participate in projects analyzing artworks in VR environments using personal devices (BYOD) to explore mathematical principles (geometry, measurement, spatial reasoning). Themes are selected considering applicability in elementary education settings, with activity designs for curriculum integration",

  "learning_goals": [
    "In a VR environment, learners can accurately analyze the geometric structures of artworks (line/point symmetry, golden ratio, perspective projection) and explain at least three of them using mathematical formulas and graph representations.",
    "Learners can complete a spatial modeling project using 3D coordinate systems (x, y, z-axes) and vector operations by analyzing three artworks, and achieve a total score of over 80 points in a peer evaluation rubric (Creativity 20%, Calculation Accuracy 30%, Implementation Completeness 30%, Collaboration 20%).",
    "Students can create a digital portfolio (3D modeling video/math analysis essay) that expresses integrated thinking in art and mathematics based on VR viewing experiences."
