    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Conducts formative assessments (quizzes, portfolio evaluations) based on interaction analysis data from digital devices, fostering a collaborative culture between instructors and learners while comprehensively evaluating learners' writing and presentation skills.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Through collaborative task performance with peers, learners enhance communication skills using target language vocabulary and grammatical structures, and strengthen reading comprehension across text types (dialogues, expository texts, etc.).",
    "Learners analyze interaction data (e.g., click-through rates, dwell time, discussion frequency) extracted from digital tools (Google Analytics, LMS dashboards) to identify three key learning patterns (e.g., concentration time distribution, engagement types, error patterns). Based on this, they revise at least two personalized learning strategies (e.g., vocabulary expansion, grammar practice frequency adjustments) and establish an implementation plan exceeding 80% execution.",
    "Learners actively engage in linguistic problem-solving processes (e.g., role-playing, peer review) grounded in social constructivist theory, developing critical thinking and creative expression skills."
