  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can independently design a mathematical modeling process 100% autonomously using real-world workplace scenarios.",
    "Learners apply statistical analysis techniques acquired from online learning modules to practical settings, producing three data-driven decision-making reports.",
    "Learners identify three work-related problems during WIL, incorporate at least five peer feedback sessions from an LMS discussion board, and present two mathematical solutions in a PPT (10–15 slides). Solutions must score at least 4 out of 5 in two of three pre-evaluation rubric criteria (problem clarity, mathematical appropriateness, feasibility)."
