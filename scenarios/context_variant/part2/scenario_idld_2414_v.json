  "learning_goals": [
    "Using multimedia materials (videos, animations, documents) provided by the Moodle LMS platform, learners can explain and apply the four principles of object-oriented programming (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction) to practical tasks",
    "Through IDLF framework-based activities (quizzes, assignments, simulations), learners can perform the entire project process from class diagram design to system analysis using UML",
    "In a VR-based coding simulation environment, learners can develop OOP solutions tailored to real-world scenarios by practicing inheritance and interface implementation",
    "Through project-based assessments combining peer and self-evaluation, learners can improve OOP design quality and apply it to real work environments"
