  "learning_goals": [
    "≥85% of learners will perform collaborative design processes (e.g., prototyping, feedback) using digital platforms and analyze text structures and vocabulary usage in interactive language education content.",
    "Participants will plan a team-based interactive storytelling tool development project for language education, complete a prototype and a 10-minute demonstration presentation within 6 months. The project must meet ≥70% of evaluation criteria (functionality 40%, educational effectiveness 30%, creativity 30%) and demonstrate improvements in expressive and reading comprehension skills within language learning contexts.",
    "All learners will enhance their ability to integrate design thinking with language education (reading, writing, speaking, listening) through ≥3 formative assessments during the course."
