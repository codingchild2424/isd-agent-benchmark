    "Using a serious game platform (e.g., PhET simulations), learners model three real-life problems (traffic flow optimization, resource distribution) with mathematical models (differential equations, graph theory) and propose solutions with 80% or higher accuracy in the game’s evaluation system.",
    "In an AI-based game simulation environment, learners collaborate with teammates to complete three or more problem-solving tasks. They achieve an \"excellent\" rating in at least three of four team evaluation checklist items (communication, role distribution, strategy development, execution efficiency).",
