  "learning_goals": [
    "When designing educational hypermedia, learners use an evaluation tool applying six criteria (Affective/Technical/Usability/Scenario/Multimedia/Educational Elements) to assess three language learning hypermedia samples, complete a 5-point scale evaluation table per criterion, and submit a report achieving over 80% total score.",
    "Integrate visual elements (photography, typography, semantic analysis) into multimedia document design for language learning to maximize vocabulary and grammar learning effectiveness.",
    "Develop a hypermedia prototype for language learning that considers learner interactivity (reading/writing feedback, pronunciation assessment) in an online asynchronous environment."
