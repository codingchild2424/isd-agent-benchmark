    "It can explain the principles of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test using the four components of the MACH model (Methods, Analogies, Context, How)",
    "It can interpret results from applying the Wilcoxon rank-sum test by analyzing real-world medical/technical data cases",
    "Even in resource-constrained technical environments, it can simulate test procedures and visually represent results using mobile apps",
    "During a mid-term course (4 weeks), learners analyze two real IT project cases, write a 5-page report structured in three stages (problem definition → technical solution → implementation plan), and achieve over 80% of the criteria in peer evaluation and instructor feedback after a 10-minute presentation."
