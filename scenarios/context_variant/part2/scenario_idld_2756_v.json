    "Explain the core principles of the Floor Time approach and propose methods for analyzing motor skill improvement data in students with cerebral palsy using mathematical measurements (frequency, duration, angles, etc.).",
    "Design an adaptive physical education program based on project-based learning, visualizing and optimizing lateral rolling ability enhancement strategies for students with cerebral palsy through statistical graphs (bar/line graphs).",
    "Learners monitor the project process (research design, data analysis, result interpretation) through three formative assessments over one week, incorporate peer and instructor feedback, and derive five or more specific instructional design improvements. Basic statistical techniques such as mean, standard deviation, and correlation are utilized in this process."
