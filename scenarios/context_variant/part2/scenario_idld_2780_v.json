  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Knowledge of basic marketing theory and practical experience. Requires understanding of foundational statistical concepts (mean, standard deviation) and ability to perform simple formula calculations",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Focuses on bridging theory-practice gaps through experiential client-based learning. Requires smartphones, considers PC-unavailable environments. Uses mobile-friendly data analysis tools (e.g., Google Sheets mobile app) for probability calculations and graphing tasks",
    "institution_type": "Graduate school",
    "learner_age": "40s and above",
    "learner_education": "Adult learner (non-degree)",
    "learner_role": "Student",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Analyze real client cases to develop an integrated implementation plan for IMC strategies and apply optimization equations (e.g., linear programming) based on budget allocation data.",
    "Learners complete a 4-week team-based experiential learning project (e.g., marketing data analysis task), achieving a score of 4 or higher (on a 5-point scale) in at least four out of five rubric items: communication (3 meeting minutes), organizational management (task allocation chart), and leadership (role adjustment). Decision-making using probabilistic modeling during budget allocation is specifically assessed.",
    "Learners independently apply IMC tools (e.g., content calendars, budget allocation sheets) in a mobile microlearning environment, enhancing competencies in data visualization (graph generation using spreadsheet functions) and statistical analysis (probability distribution calculations)."
