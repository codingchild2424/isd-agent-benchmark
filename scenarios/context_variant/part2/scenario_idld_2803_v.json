    "Learners will analyze two weeks of language learning data (e.g., vocabulary test results, pronunciation scores) collected via personal BYOD devices (smartphones/tablets). They will generate a weekly personalized feedback report (including 3 learning strengths/weaknesses and 2 improvement strategies) and incorporate it into the next week’s learning plan."
