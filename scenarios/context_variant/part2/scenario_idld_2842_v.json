    "Developing collaborative, differentiated, and collective knowledge-building learning activities focused on solving mathematical problems (e.g., equation solving, graph interpretation)",
    "Learners produce one MOOC design guideline applicable to real school settings (primary/secondary) through project-based assessment (teams of 4–6 members), meeting the following criteria: 1) verification of integration with three or more mathematics curricula (e.g., equations, geometry, statistics), 2) specification of a five-stage design process (needs analysis → formula derivation → problem structuring → assessment design → feedback incorporation), 3) incorporation of feedback from at least two field teachers"
