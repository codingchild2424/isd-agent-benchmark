    "additional_context": "A course for math experts in medical, legal, and technical fields to strengthen organizational decision-making competencies. Conducting asynchronous learning and group collaboration in a BYOD environment, learners focus on solving complex organizational problems using advanced mathematical techniques (graph theory, simulations, probabilistic modeling).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can analyze core elements of an organizational vision framework (core values, future vision, strategic emphases) using linear/nonlinear equations and optimization techniques.",
    "Using online collaboration tools, learners draft a shared vision per team and iteratively refine it through feedback to probabilistically predict over 80% participant satisfaction.",
    "Through project-based assessment, learners develop a vision implementation roadmap applying real corporate cases and meet both quantitative (regression analysis, A/B testing) and qualitative evaluation criteria."
