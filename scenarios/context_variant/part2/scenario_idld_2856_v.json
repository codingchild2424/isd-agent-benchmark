    "Explain three or more frameworks for teaching mathematical concepts using the SoTL (Scholarship of Teaching and Learning) approach, including formal derivation, graph interpretation, and problem-solving strategies.",
    "Compare and analyze strategies for developing individual (computational skill enhancement) and collective (proof collaboration) expertise in blended learning environments.",
    "Apply a five-stage system model (data collection → statistical analysis → result interpretation → strategy revision → re-evaluation) to assess the long-term effects of faculty development programs.",
    "Propose two improvement plans linking learner feedback (error patterns in problem-solving) with institutional practices (standardized assessment systems)."
