    "Within two weeks after the course, learners document three or more specific educational practice change cases (e.g., lesson design improvements, assessment method innovations, learner engagement strategies) in their portfolios, including pre-post comparison data and performance metrics (e.g., 15% increase in learner satisfaction, 20% rise in class participation) for each case."
