    "Analyze feedback from English conversation models to improve pronunciation and grammatical errors related to mathematics (e.g., pronunciation of 'variable', sentence structure for 'probability') by at least 80%",
    "Acquire English presentation skills applicable to real-world mathematical work environments (e.g., data analysis report presentations) through PBL task performance",
    "Secure at least two hours of self-directed learning per week through interaction with conversational learning models and link it to mathematical problem-solving skills"
