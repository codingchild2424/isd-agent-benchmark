    "In online settings, signature pedagogy in art education (practice, critique, collaborative creation) is applied to design lessons reflecting sociocultural contexts.",
    "Learners implement three online art education activities (e.g., cultural comparison collage, community-themed collaborative creation, historical art style analysis) using digital tools (Adobe Premiere, Google Workspace, etc.) and submit an improved report (3 pages) incorporating peer evaluations and instructor feedback.",
    "Within four weeks, learners create online instructional materials (3 interactive worksheets, 1 virtual gallery) reflecting elementary students’ (grades 3–6) art learning characteristics (visual engagement, interactivity, simplified concept explanations) and socioemotional development stages. They must achieve an \"Excellent\" rating in at least four of the five expert feedback criteria: creativity, cultural diversity reflection, interactivity, etc."
