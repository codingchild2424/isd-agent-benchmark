    "prior_knowledge": "Grasps fundamental concepts with intermediate-level application skills. Understands basic language instructional design and language learning theories (e.g., Input Hypothesis, Interaction Hypothesis)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Simulation/VR-based",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A process for pre-service and in-service teachers to experiment with and analyze language instruction design applying cognitive load theory in VR simulation environments. Focuses on diagnosing and resolving cognitive load factors in second language acquisition from a linguistic perspective.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will differentiate the three types of cognitive load (intrinsic, extraneous, germane) and apply them to language learning scenarios to measure learners' text-processing load.",
    "Using a provided complexity framework, learners will predict cognitive load for language learning tasks and design optimal arrangements for vocabulary and grammar elements.",
    "Learners will design cognitive load manipulation experiments for language learning tasks (e.g., chunk-based sentence construction) in simulation/VR environments and analyze effectiveness variations based on individual language proficiency differences.",
    "Learners conduct three formative assessments at two-week intervals, revise the language instructional design in two or more ways based on peer and instructor feedback, and submit a language lesson plan applying cognitive load management strategies (e.g., chunking, visual cues)."
