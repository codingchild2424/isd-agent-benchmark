  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will enhance their ability to solve problems by applying resilience strategies in professional scenarios through linguistic expressions (speaking/writing).",
    "Learners will textually analyze professional ethics codes and apply ethical decision-making frameworks to real project situations through linguistic communication (discussions/reports).",
    "Using an interdisciplinary approach (engineering + humanities + business), learners will linguistically collaborate (meetings/document drafting) with team members in complex work scenarios (e.g., global project management), proposing at least three creative solutions, and achieving an average of 4/5 or higher in peer and instructor evaluations.",
    "In monthly formative assessments, learners will score 7/10+ on resilience scales, meet six or more of eight ethical awareness checklist items through linguistic expressions (essays/presentations), and submit an improvement plan in linguistic format (report) within two weeks based on results."
