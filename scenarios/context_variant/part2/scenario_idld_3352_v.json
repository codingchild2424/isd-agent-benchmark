    "Learners co-create customized corporate educational resources (three videos, two practical guides) using a student-instructor collaboration model over six months and submit project deliverables that meet predefined evaluation standards (80% content completeness, 90% collaboration participation).",
    "At the end of the six-month course, learners produce three types of interactive math content (quizzes, simulations, animations) optimized for asynchronous learning environments (corporate LMS, video platforms, etc.) and achieve an average effectiveness rating of over 4 points (5-point scale) in user testing (five or more participants).",
    "Develop the ability to verify educational resource effectiveness through feedback-driven iterative improvements",
    "Within six months, learners prepare a global educational resource development strategy document reflecting international standards (ISO/IEC 29110) and local cultural differences, and establish budget/schedule/quality management plans based on case analyses of three or more overseas markets."
