Additionally, they must use precise mathematical terminology and logical expressions during model development.",
    "After conducting formative assessments (quizzes, observation checklists) on three AR contents, learners write an educational effectiveness analysis report achieving at least 4 points (5-point scale) in interactivity and intuitiveness. The report must include mathematical analysis results and clear linguistic expression (vocabulary, grammar, logical flow)."
