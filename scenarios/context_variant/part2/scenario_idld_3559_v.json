    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Real-time video lectures in digital-device-provided environments, operated with summative assessment focus. Most learners require initial adaptation to online education; key challenges include improving expression accuracy and reading comprehension in asynchronous language learning. Integration of language support features like in-platform vocabulary quizzes and grammar-checking tools planned.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners independently utilize online learning platforms and tools within 2 weeks, acquiring proficiency in effectively navigating digital language learning resources (text/multimedia).",
    "By week 3, learners collaborate with three peers using online tools (Google Docs/Slack) to draft project plans, achieving ≥80% feedback incorporation and ≥4 points (5-point scale) in role clarity while producing documents adhering to academic writing standards.",
    "By week 8, learners use online platforms (Google Calendar, Notion) to plan ≥10 weekly language learning hours, achieve ≥80% execution over 4 weeks, and submit weekly reflection journals (500+ characters) analyzing learning content, vocabulary acquisition, and expression proficiency improvements.",
    "At course completion, learners identify five key barriers to online education transitions (e.g., asynchronous communication limits, digital literacy gaps) and propose solutions (e.g., customized vocabulary feedback systems, real-time pronunciation tools) to enhance language learning effectiveness."
