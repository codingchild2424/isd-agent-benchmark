    "Learners identify their learning patterns (4 types: content navigation/assessment orientation, etc.) via learning analytics (LA) tools and document improvement plans three or more times in weekly reflection journals",
    "Learners will select three real-life mathematical problems in a 2-week team project (3–4 members per group), develop a portfolio documenting the problem-solving process (including problem definition, mathematical modeling, solution methods, and result analysis), and submit the final output after achieving a score of 4 or higher on a 5-point peer evaluation rubric (clarity, creativity, collaboration)."
