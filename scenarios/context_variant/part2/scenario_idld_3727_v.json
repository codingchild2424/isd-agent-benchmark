    "Learners identify ≥2 elements each from the TPACK framework’s Technology (T), Content (K), and Pedagogy (P) domains, create one integrated lesson plan combining mathematical proofs and problem-solving, and revise it incorporating peer feedback scoring ≥4/5 points in ≥4 of 5 rubric items",
    "In 4-member teams, learners complete one 6-week PBL module for mathematical inquiry and real-world problem-solving using online collaboration tools (e.g., Google Workspace, Notion), submitting a 10-15-page project report and 10-minute presentation video. Teams must achieve ≥4/5 points in ≥4 of 5 rubric items"
