  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners identify technical elements of the javelin-throwing motion at 80%+ accuracy per phase and explain them using linguistic expressions (vocabulary, grammar).",
    "Learners correct errors occurring during javelin-throwing performance three consecutive times through problem-solving practice and provide clear linguistic feedback (pronunciation, expression) to peers.",
    "Learners apply biomechanical principles to improve motion efficiency by 15% during javelin-throwing based on instructor explanations and organize findings into structured text (written work, reports).",
    "Learners receive feedback from three or more peers via PBL (Problem-Based Learning), establish improvement plans in two of three language skills (pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar), submit weekly implementation reports (reading comprehension, expression) over eight weeks, and achieve ≥70% goal attainment."
