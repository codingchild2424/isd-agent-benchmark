    "Learners can comparatively analyze the cognitive and affective effects (e.g., vocabulary acquisition efficiency, grammar comprehension improvement) of applying DGBL (Digital Game-Based Learning) before/after STEM language classes.",
    "Through project-based collaboration, learners develop language problem-solving strategies applicable to real-world professional scenarios (medical/legal/technical fields), such as specialized terminology usage and context-specific expression construction.",
    "Learners analyze log data (playtime, error frequency, repetition count, etc.) from a game-based language learning platform to evaluate their learning patterns (e.g., vocabulary acquisition speed, grammar error types), propose at least three specific improvement plans (e.g., adjusting focused study time, repeated practice of weak grammar types, specialized vocabulary reinforcement training), and incorporate them into a weekly learning plan."
