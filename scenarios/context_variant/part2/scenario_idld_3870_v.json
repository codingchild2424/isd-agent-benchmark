    "Utilizing Problem-Based Learning (PBL), learners evaluate complex nursing cases reflecting real clinical situations.",
    "Within one week, learners measure mental effort levels ≥3 times using cognitive load monitoring tools (NASA-TLX survey) and propose ≥2 adjustments to reduce intrinsic load (task segmentation, interface simplification)",
    "Within one week, teams develop nursing education module prototypes applying cognitive load minimization strategies (chunking, visual hierarchy, feedback systems), submitting deliverables meeting predefined criteria (usability test ≥80% pass rate, cognitive load survey ≥4/5)"
