    "Students enhance their ability to observe daily phenomena and generate questions by integrating scientific inquiry processes with mathematical analysis methods.",
    "Students accurately perform the process of hypothesis verification and conclusion derivation through experimental design and data analysis (organizing measurements, creating graphs, statistical verification, etc.) with over 80% accuracy.",
    "Learners collaborate in teams of 4–5 members, incorporate peer feedback at least twice, and produce a 15-page inquiry report (including mathematical modeling and scientific analysis). They achieve a grade of B or higher in at least four out of five rubric criteria: clarity of topic, logical coherence, fidelity of evidence, creativity, and feedback incorporation."
