Language proficiency and communication skill improvement indicators must be included",
    "Learners identify three or more WBL strategy elements reflecting gender differences (e.g., gender-specific vocabulary training, culturally contextualized expression practice), apply them to a project plan template, and submit a final report incorporating team feedback within two weeks"
