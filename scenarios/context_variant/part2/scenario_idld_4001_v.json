    "Through 2 weeks of active learning activities (3 case studies, 2 discussions, 1 simulation), learners will design one workplace occupational disease prevention strategy and deliver a 5-minute presentation achieving at least 2 points (out of 3) based on peer evaluation criteria (clarity, practicality, creativity). The process must include communication improvement strategies between workers and managers.",
