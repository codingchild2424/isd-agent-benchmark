    "Learners perform FCA-based language intervention strategies in a simulated environment under expert supervision.",
    "Learners observe three role-model cases for improving family relationships (e.g., communication skills, conflict resolution strategies, empathetic responses), attempt ≥2 collaborative dialogues with actual family members to promote language development, and achieve ≥20% improvement in pre-post relationship satisfaction surveys."
