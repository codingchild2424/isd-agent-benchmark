    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",

    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Focus on smartphone-based learning activities, with weekly face-to-face sessions. Learners perform real-time text analysis, voice recording assessments, and vocabulary quiz generation via mobile apps. All instructional models are designed considering language acquisition theories and classroom applicability.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will enhance their English lesson design capabilities using the Understanding by Design (UbD) framework, particularly strengthening text structure analysis skills for integrated reading-writing activities.",
    "Learners will select one or more teaching methods, apply the four-stage action research cycle (plan-act-observe-reflect) over two weeks, collect observational data (three class recordings, five learner feedbacks), and write a report proposing three linguistic improvement strategies: vocabulary frequency analysis, expression accuracy evaluation, and grammar error pattern identification.",
    "Learners will develop a one-period English lesson model for 3rd–4th graders through project-based assessment during a 2–4-week intermediate course and submit a lesson design meeting four or more of five evaluation criteria (grammar accuracy, vocabulary diversity, communicative effectiveness, cultural appropriateness, learner engagement) in peer and expert reviews."
