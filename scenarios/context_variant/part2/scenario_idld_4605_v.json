    "Provide at least three constructive feedbacks (e.g., formal derivation process, variable control methods) on peers’ experiment designs through peer evaluation.",
    "Develop at least two online-offline integration strategies (e.g., virtual experiment-real measurement linkage, data visualization collaboration) to enhance learner engagement in blended environments."
