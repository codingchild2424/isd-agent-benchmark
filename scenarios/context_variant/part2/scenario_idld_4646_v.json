    "Learners analyze five complex problem cases from three or more clinical settings (e.g., hospitals, nursing homes, rehabilitation centers), apply situation-aware approaches (e.g., 5Why analysis, SWOT assessment) to propose solutions, and write a report meeting evaluation criteria (80% accuracy in problem definition, 80% feasibility in solutions).",
    "In a simulation environment, learners perform five clinical decision-making scenarios with team members (e.g., nurses, doctors) and environmental factors (e.g., medical equipment, patient records), making decisions that meet at least six of the eight evaluation checklist items per scenario.",
    "In a service/customer interaction simulation formative assessment, learners reflectively analyze their reasoning process in three stages (situation awareness → judgment basis → alternative evaluation), establish at least two specific improvement plans based on evaluator feedback, and apply them to practical scenarios."
