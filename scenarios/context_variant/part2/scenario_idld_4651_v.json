    "Within a 6-month course, learners design three context-based e-learning modules (1 theoretical, 1 practical, 1 simulation) for solving real-world scientific problems (e.g., environmental monitoring, data analysis) and obtain a suitability rating of at least 4 out of 5 from an expert evaluation panel.",
    "Within a 6-month course, learners develop a three-stage framework (design-link-evaluate) that systematically connects learning activities, storylines, and reflective opportunities in science education design, achieving over 80% suitability scores in peer evaluations and expert reviews.",
    "Creating materials using technology tools optimized for BYOD environments",
    "Within 6 months, learners develop a 20-item multiple-choice comprehensive assessment tool to measure understanding of core concepts in science curricula (physics, chemistry, biology) and submit a report earning a content validity index (CVI) of 0.8 or higher (based on a 4-point scale) from a three-member expert review panel.",
    "Within 6 months, learners establish a sustainable resource development strategy to address local community environmental issues (e.g., reducing plastic waste) and, after consulting with at least five stakeholders (residents, businesses, government), propose a feasible plan meeting at least six of eight criteria on a feasibility evaluation checklist."
