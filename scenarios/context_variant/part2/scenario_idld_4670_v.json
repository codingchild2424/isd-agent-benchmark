    "Students explain conceptual principles of fraction division (e.g., reciprocal multiplication) through visual models and verbal explanations with ≥85% accuracy and apply them to analyze social phenomena (e.g., resource distribution).",
    "Learners achieve procedural fluency by solving diverse fraction division problems with ≥90% accuracy and interpret results in social contexts (e.g., budget allocation).",
    "Over 2–4 weeks, learners complete a social studies-based project (e.g., designing solutions for local community issues) and write a teaching method proposal meeting the following conditions: 1) Integration of ≥3 social concepts (e.g., civic engagement, social equity, community collaboration) and ≥2 procedural skills (e.g., surveys, data visualization, stakeholder mapping), 2) ≥80% achievement on a rubric evaluating practical applicability in three aspects (field suitability, ease of implementation, effectiveness)."
