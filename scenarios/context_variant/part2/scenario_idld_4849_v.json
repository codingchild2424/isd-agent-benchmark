  "learning_goals": [
    "Develop the ability to design Malay language learning activities based on a multisensory approach.",
    "Learners understand the five-step process for developing educational materials reflecting cognitive characteristics of dyslexic children (visual processing, working memory, attention span, etc.) and submit prototypes meeting at least six out of eight checklist items by applying them to three real cases.",
    "Using digital-physical hybrid learning tools (AR/VR simulations, IoT devices, etc.), learners create three teaching scenarios for service/customer interaction fields. They submit results meeting at least four of five evaluation criteria (goal clarity, tool suitability, interaction design, practicality, scalability) from peer and expert reviews.",
    "Learners design at least three integrated strategies (tactile: sample product experience, auditory: customized music/guidance, visual: digital menu boards) to improve customer engagement by 20% in service settings. They collect effectiveness verification data through at least two real scenario tests."
