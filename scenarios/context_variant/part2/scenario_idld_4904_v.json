    "Over a six-month course, learners will write reflective journals twice monthly to analyze three cases of uncertainty experiences in the design process, derive one personal growth plan and one professional improvement strategy, incorporate mentor feedback, and reflect them in the final portfolio.",
    "Learners identify three or more emotions (e.g., anxiety, excitement, skepticism) in uncertain situations during customer interactions (e.g., sudden claims, ambiguous requirements) and derive two or more customized strategies using a pre-provided emotion management template (e.g., breathing regulation, cognitive restructuring, situational reframing), achieving over 80% performance in role-play assessments.",
    "Learners identify three external environmental changes (e.g., market trends, regulatory shifts) and two internal decision-making conflict factors (e.g., differing team priorities, budget constraints) during design solution development, draft a collaborative framework reflecting these within three weeks, and achieve over 80% satisfaction in team feedback."
