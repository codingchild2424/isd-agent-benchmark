  "learning_goals": [
    "Through participatory workshops, learners design three or more game prototypes that connect learners' physical activities with mathematical concepts (e.g., equations, graphs, probability).",
    "Within one week, learners develop a gamified lesson model structured in three phases (introduction-development-conclusion) using digital tools like Kahoot! or GeoGebra AR, achieving an average score of 4+ (5-point scale) in peer review and expert evaluation. The model must include math problem-solving processes and computational skill reinforcement.",
    "Learners create and mutually evaluate an assessment rubric applying **child-centered design principles** and math learning criteria, incorporating elements such as problem-solving accuracy, creative approaches, and statistical analysis."
