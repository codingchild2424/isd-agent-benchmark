    "Learners will diagnose weekly language learning patterns (reading/writing frequency, vocabulary acquisition trends) with 80% accuracy using learning analytics tools.",
    "Learners will establish and execute self-directed language practice plans (pronunciation training, situational conversation exercises) in a VR simulation environment.",
    "Learners will experience a process of improving their learning strategies twice or more based on real-time language learning feedback (grammar error analysis, expression diversity evaluation).",
    "Learners will collect and analyze interaction data (meeting minutes, chat logs, feedback surveys) with peer learners during a team project, derive three collaboration improvement strategies (communication efficiency, feedback system, role distribution), and apply at least two of them in the next project cycle."
