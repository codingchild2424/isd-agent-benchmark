    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",

Learners engage in language activities such as acquiring specialized terminology, writing tactical explanations, and developing inter-team communication strategies during game analysis.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners analyze ten or more team sports (e.g., soccer, basketball) game videos, identify five or more situational language variables (e.g., tactical instructions, communication patterns), and achieve over 80% accuracy in predicting behavioral possibilities based on simulations.",
    "Designing representative language learning environments using constraints and inducing changes in team interaction communication strategies.",
    "During a 6-month long-term training course, learners create a training plan including weekly/monthly/quarterly language goals (grammar, vocabulary, expressions) and revise behavior adaptation strategies with over 80% accuracy based on actual training data (communication frequency, response accuracy)."
