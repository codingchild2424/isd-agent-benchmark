    "Students with special educational needs achieve over 80% proficiency in foundational math skills (calculation, geometry, measurement) using a personalized learning platform.",
    "Learners independently operate platform accessibility features (screen readers, voice commands, zoom tools) with 90% accuracy and utilize formula input and graph interpretation functions.",
    "Students analyze three or more error types (e.g., equation-solving mistakes, omitted geometric proofs, failed statistical data interpretation) based on monthly formative assessment results and revise and implement personalized learning strategies (e.g., concept review, problem-solving reinforcement, visual aids) within two weeks.",
    "Teachers use platform analytics tools (learning data visualization, error pattern tracking) to establish and apply customized feedback strategies (e.g., step-by-step problem-solving guides, proof-process emphasis) for individual learners."
