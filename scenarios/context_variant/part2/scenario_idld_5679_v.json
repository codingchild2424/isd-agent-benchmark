    "Learners can visualize at least three core scientific concepts, such as wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics, the theory of relativity, and the laws of thermodynamics, using drawing or collage techniques, and produce work that meets or exceeds a score of 4 (on a 5-point scale) in terms of clarity and creativity based on peer evaluation and instructor feedback.",
    "Learners utilize artistic thinking techniques (such as metaphor, analogy, and visual representation) to generate three or more creative ideas when designing science experiments, and through peer evaluation and instructor feedback, they can apply two or more ideas to the final experimental design.",
    "Peer evaluation simultaneously assesses the scientific validity and artistic completeness of integrated art-science outputs.",
    "Three or more problem-solving cases are developed using art-integrated approaches in daily work contexts."
