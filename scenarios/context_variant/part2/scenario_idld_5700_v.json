    "Learners can systematically explain crime scene evidence collection and preservation procedures according to legal and scientific standards",
    "Scientific analysis methods can be applied to evaluate the legal validity and societal impact of evidence.",
    "Learners, working in teams of 4–5 members, perform real-case simulations (e.g., community conflict resolution cases) and submit project outcomes achieving at least 3 out of 5 points in each of the four collaborative competency rubric items: communication, role distribution, problem-solving, and result derivation. This enables the formulation of civic rights and institutional improvement strategies."
