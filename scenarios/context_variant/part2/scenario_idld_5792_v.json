    "Learners can explain text-based communication strategies for effective language exchange in agricultural knowledge networks",
    "Using smartphone-based microlearning tools (e.g., KakaoTalk Open Chat, Band), learners collaborate with three peer farmers to create two crop cultivation experience-sharing posts (considering grammatical accuracy, vocabulary diversity, and logical structure) and provide constructive feedback (clarity, practicality, empathetic expression) on at least one peer post",
    "After a one-week short course, learners specify three practical strategies for building local agricultural networks (producer-consumer direct trade platform, co-branding, distribution cooperative) in a project report and explain two core strategies with structured language (introduction-body-conclusion) in a 5-minute presentation"
