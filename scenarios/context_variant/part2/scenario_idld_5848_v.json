  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Completion of advanced courses and extensive practical experience in specialized fields, proficiency in basic grammar/vocabulary, and experience with digital tools",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Integration of innovative technologies like VR/simulation and microlearning to enhance language learning motivation. A formative assessment-centered feedback system monitors and supports continuous improvement in reading comprehension, expression, and pronunciation accuracy.",
    "institution_type": "University (undergraduate)",
    "learner_age": "In their 20s",
    "learner_education": "High school",
    "learner_role": "Student",
    "domain_expertise": "Advanced"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Independently design and execute 15-minute language learning content (integrating vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation) using microlearning modules with over 80% autonomy.",
    "Successfully complete over 70% of contextual communication tasks (role-play, situational dialogues) in the target language within a VR simulation environment.",
    "Using language learning analytics tools (e.g., Duolingo, Quizlet Analytics), learners track their language acquisition patterns (vocabulary expansion, grammatical structures, pronunciation accuracy) for four weeks and establish three or more specific improvement plans (e.g., adjusting daily vocabulary intake, setting weekly grammar review cycles, pronunciation correction training) based on analysis results.",
    "Collaborate with peers using collaboration tools (Google Docs, Padlet) to complete two or more language creation projects (digital storytelling, cultural comparison videos)."
