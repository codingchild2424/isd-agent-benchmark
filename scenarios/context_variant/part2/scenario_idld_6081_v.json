    "Learners can analyze their educational philosophy into three core elements (e.g., constructivism, behaviorism, socioculturalism), design a two-session lesson plan reflecting blended teaching methods (teacher-centered + student-centered), and achieve a score of 4 or higher (out of 5) in peer evaluation and instructor feedback.",
    "Learners compare and evaluate various educational philosophies (progressivism, constructivism, etc.) aligned with science curricula and integrate them contextually into lessons.",
    "Participants can design formative assessment tools (10-question quiz, 5-item observation checklist) suitable for a science curriculum (e.g., basic physics) within two weeks, apply them to 10 learners, and submit an analysis report with feedback (including three improvement recommendations)."
