At the month-end evaluation, they apply a rubric (clarity, specificity, improvement plan) and achieve a score of 4 or higher (out of 5) to measure learning outcomes.",
    "At the end of the 6-month long-term course, learners quantitatively analyze competency improvement using a digital assessment tool (10 survey questions + 3-stage simulation) that measures empathy (4 or higher on a 5-point scale) and service design skills (80% or higher in real-case application evaluation)."
