    "Cultivate the ability to design optimal grammar/vocabulary learning paths for individuals using an AI recommendation system based on learner profile analysis",
    "Learners design three types of language practice content (pronunciation evaluation, sentence correction, text restructuring) using customized feedback algorithms (e.g., ChatGPT API, Grammarly), operate them for 10 learners over four weeks, and provide feedback achieving over 80% satisfaction in surveys (improvements in lexical diversity, grammatical accuracy, expressive fluency)",
    "At the end of a six-month course, learners analyze learner achievement data (attendance, assessment scores, assignment completion rates) extracted from an LMS system, propose three instructional improvement strategies (e.g., enhanced customized feedback, activity-based learning introduction, assessment system adjustment), and write a report recognized as over 80% valid by an institutional review committee (including grammar error pattern analysis, vocabulary acquisition efficiency evaluation, expressive fluency metrics)"
