    "Learners propose detailed designs for smartphone-based language activities (text analysis, voice recording, vocabulary quizzes) in blended learning environments.",
    "Learners analyze three onsite/remote language education case studies, identify ≥3 differences in instructional design (language input methods by environment, feedback types by interaction mode, language proficiency measurement by assessment), and create a comparative table."
