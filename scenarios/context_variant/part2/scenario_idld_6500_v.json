    "Learners apply Piaget’s cognitive development theory (preoperational, concrete operational stages) to design one VR language-learning scenario for elementary students (ages 7–12), create multimedia materials using 3D modeling tools (Blender, etc.) to promote vocabulary acquisition and contextual understanding of biological terms (plant structures, animal classification, etc.), and achieve an average score of ≥4/5 on peer and instructor evaluations.",
    "Cultivation of biology content design skills integrating audio explanations (biological concept explanations) and visual elements (3D models, animations) to enhance learners’ reading comprehension and expressive abilities.",
    "Learners operate a 3-phase (design-implementation-analysis) VR-based formative assessment system (quizzes, observation records, discussion activities) for ≥50 learners, write a ≥10-page user manual, and achieve ≥4/5 on learner satisfaction surveys.",
