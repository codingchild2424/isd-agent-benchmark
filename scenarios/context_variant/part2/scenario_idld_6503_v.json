    "Learners can explain the principles of the '+1' addition rule (n + 1 and 1 + n) through structured discovery activities.",
    "Learners establish strategies to solve problems by applying the '+1' rule across diverse number ranges.",
    "Learners can transfer the trained 'near-doubles' strategy to untrained items with similar patterns.",
    "Learners collaborate with a group of 3–4 peers to analyze patterns discovered while solving three types of addition problems (e.g., integers, fractions, polynomials) within two weeks and write a 500-character report explaining the generalizability of addition rules."
