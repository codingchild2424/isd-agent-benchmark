    "Learners develop at least two technology-integrated lesson scenarios based on real social studies classroom cases (e.g., regional culture comparison projects) collected in mobile environments.",
    "Learners reflect on at least three peer feedback sessions, propose at least one improved social studies learning support plan (e.g., AI-based local issue simulation tools) within two weeks, and submit a report meeting at least two of three evaluation criteria (innovation, feasibility, effectiveness)."
