    "Learners can design optimization problems reflecting three or more sustainability indicators (social/environmental/economic).",
    "Learners can perform resource allocation simulations using real urban data and write an interpretive report on the results.",
    "Learners collaborate in interdisciplinary teams (3–5 members: developers, designers, planners, etc.) to develop an integrated software solution prototype (implementing ≥3 features) using Agile methods within two weeks, create a 10-minute presentation (10 slides + 3-minute demo video), and submit it at the final presentation session"
