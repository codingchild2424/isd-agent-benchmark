  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners accurately comprehend and listen to target-language scientific texts/audio materials (e.g., pandemic response) at 80% or higher accuracy through group inquiry in an IVR environment and structurally explain key content.",
    "Learners perform three or more role-plays/debates with peers using target-language communication strategies (questions, requests, persuasive expressions) in a VR simulation, utilizing collaboration tools (screen sharing, voice chat).",
    "Learners systematically document and present case studies of vocabulary and grammar usage related to scientific topics, practical outcomes, and self-reflection (analysis of communication barriers) in language portfolios created based on IVR learning experiences."
