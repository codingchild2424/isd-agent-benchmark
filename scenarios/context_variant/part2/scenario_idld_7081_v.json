    "Learners create a comparative analysis table of the pros/cons of three blended learning models (flipped learning, blended learning, hybrid learning), propose at least two improvements considering applicability to nursing education, present the analysis in a team PPT (5–7 slides), and score over 2/3 points based on evaluation criteria (clarity, feasibility, innovativeness)."
