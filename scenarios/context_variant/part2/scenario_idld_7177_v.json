    "At the end of the four-week course, learners achieve at least 70 points (out of 100) on the assessment rubric (content 40%, delivery 30%, visual effects 30%) by orally presenting design outcomes within 10 minutes and delivering visual materials (minimum 10 slides of PPT/infographics) in project-based assessments (teams of 3–5 members)"
