    "Develop an instructional design document applying the five core competencies of digital citizenship (ethical behavior, information evaluation, communication, collaboration, problem-solving) to mathematics education",
    "Develop a gamification-based digital citizenship education module utilizing LMS and smartphones",
    "Learners develop an evaluation rubric that measures learner engagement (attendance ≥80%, discussion participation ≥10 times), knowledge acquisition (20% improvement in pre-post test scores), and behavioral change (≥3 real-classroom application cases) when designing hybrid assessment tools, and validate its validity through peer review and expert evaluation."
