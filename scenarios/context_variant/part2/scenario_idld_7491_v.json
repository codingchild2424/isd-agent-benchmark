  "title": "VR-Based Scientific Inquiry Hybrid Learning Design for Wine Education",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Completion of advanced studies and experience in high-level project execution, with foundational understanding of scientific inquiry methods (observation, hypothesis formulation, experimental design)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learners may be unfamiliar with digital devices but possess advanced wine expertise. Project-based assessments apply VR learning experiences to real wine service scenarios, emphasizing scientific analysis (variable control, data interpretation). The learning process systematically incorporates scientific procedures such as experimental documentation, evidence collection, and conclusion derivation.",

    "learner_role": "Student",
    "domain_expertise": "Advanced"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can improve their ability to identify chemical variables and sensory characteristics of wines by region using scientific observation methods in VR environments",
    "Learners can reproduce the wine tasting process (color, aroma, taste measurement) with 80% accuracy using gamification elements and analyze experimental data",
    "Learners can complete wine pairing projects through collaboration with peers in blended learning environments and evaluate results based on scientific evidence"
