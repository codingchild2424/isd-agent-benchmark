    "When performing robot control coding projects (3+ times), learners write a report in clear vocabulary and grammatical structure that meets at least 4 of 5 checklist items for self-awareness (emotional/cognitive monitoring) and self-management (time/resource planning) competencies.",
    "While performing team-based coding tasks, learners assess social awareness and relationship management skills and apply effective communication (listening/speaking) strategies during collaboration.",
    "Learners complete three collaborative robotics tasks (e.g., disaster response simulation) in a VR simulation environment, achieve an average of 4/5 points or higher on a 5-point scale for responsible decision-making (incorporating team input, considering risks, predicting outcomes), and express the process in structured text."
