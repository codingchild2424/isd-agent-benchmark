    "Learners can linguistically analyze and evaluate a cricket batter’s behavior (shot selection, technical efficiency), cognition (strategic thinking), and emotion (psychological stability) in a simulation game environment.",
    "Learners can identify external outcome-driven strategic thinking through linguistic feedback (80%+ accuracy) by comparing experts and novices.",
    "Learners can establish and execute personalized skill improvement plans based on individual batting data (ball contact accuracy, scoring rate) and linguistic self-assessment reports."
