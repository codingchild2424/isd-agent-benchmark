    "Learners can explain mathematical concepts with over 80% accuracy using digital tools (apps/platforms) in a blended learning environment.",
    "Through online-offline collaborative activities, learners can effectively exchange peer feedback three or more times during mathematical problem-solving processes.",
    "Learners can select three real-world problem scenarios reflecting theological educational philosophy (e.g., church architectural design, religious art pattern analysis), write a 10-page report analyzing mathematical principles (geometry, proportion, symmetry) applied in each case, and achieve an \"Excellent\" grade in at least two of three rubric criteria (problem definition clarity, mathematical application appropriateness, theological connectivity)."
