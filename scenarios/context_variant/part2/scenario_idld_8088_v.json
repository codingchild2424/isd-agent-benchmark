    "Learners can design a linguistic explanation system for a medical procedure skills training module by applying Gagné’s instructional design model",
    "Learners can acquire expression strategies to clearly convey medical terminology using interactive workshop techniques and develop patient-healthcare provider communication scenarios",
    "Through project-based assessment, learners can apply medical procedure training scenarios to real-world contexts and produce explanatory materials that balance specialized terminology with everyday language"
