    "Learners identify at least three differences between deep/shallow learning types in science subjects (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.) and design two or more customized teaching strategies per type. They achieve over 80% suitability scores in peer and expert reviews.",
    "By analyzing survey results on learning tendencies by gender (male/female) and age group (20-24/25-29), learners create lesson plans combining three collaborative learning strategies and two competitive learning strategies. They achieve over 80% suitability in peer and expert reviews.",
    "Build a system for analyzing individual learning patterns using formative assessment data in an LMS environment."
