    "Learners use professional terminology describing wound conditions (infection/necrosis/moisture level) to select appropriate dressing products with 90%+ accuracy.",
    "Over a 2-week intermediate course, learners use online clinical pathway simulation tools (e.g., SimX, Shadow Health), receive 3+ peer feedback sessions, complete 2+ 1:1 instructor coaching sessions, achieve 80%+ on simulation performance rubrics, and use accurate professional terminology in medical record documentation."
