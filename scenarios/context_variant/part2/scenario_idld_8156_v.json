    "Learners can perform language learning activities (e.g., vocabulary practice, writing feedback) with over 80% accuracy using TEL tools based on LMS.",
    "Learners can apply and analyze the practical principles of educational technology (value-added, clarity, coherence, tolerance) to real-world cases.",
    "Learners can write a project report designing and proposing TEL strategies suitable for their learning style and classroom environment."
