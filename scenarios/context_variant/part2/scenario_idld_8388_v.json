    "Within six months, learners analyze mathematical profiles (learning styles, strengths/weaknesses, interests) of three peers, develop ≥3 customized lesson designs applying tailored pedagogies (e.g., visual aids for geometry, real-life problems for probability, collaborative learning for statistics), and achieve ≥80% satisfaction in peer reviews and instructor feedback",
    "Conduct ≥3 cycles of peer feedback and self-reflection through project-based assessments (e.g., incorporating quantitative/qualitative evaluations into calculus lesson designs)"
