  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners analyze functional requirements (hardware/software) and budget ranges of various technological tools to select those aligned with language learning objectives (e.g., vocabulary expansion, grammar practice, pronunciation correction).",
    "Using a technology integration checklist, learners design a process to comprehensively evaluate language education needs of learners, teachers, and institutions (e.g., writing feedback, speaking assessment, reading support).",
    "Over a 1–6 month long-term course, learners establish detailed implementation plans (3+ phases) applying two or more tech tools (Quizlet, Google Classroom, etc.) to real language education scenarios (e.g., classroom role-play, virtual language exchange) through three project-based assessments. They achieve \"Excellent\" in four or more of five rubric items (fluency, accuracy, interaction, creativity, tech utilization)."
