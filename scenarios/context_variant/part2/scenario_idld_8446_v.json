    "Students complete a six-step process (Problem Definition → Algorithm Design → Simulation → Implementation → Testing → Report Writing) to solve real robot navigation problems (e.g., maze exploration, obstacle avoidance) in 3–4-member team projects over six months. They achieve ≥70 points in final presentations based on evaluation criteria (Functionality 40%, Creativity 30%, Collaboration 30%) and synthesize project results through technical and linguistic expression.",
