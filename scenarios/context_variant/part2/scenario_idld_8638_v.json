    "Learners can analyze language learner engagement data (text interaction, pronunciation accuracy, task completion) using cloud-based tools and propose improvement strategies",
    "Learners can explain methods for operating real-time feedback systems based on formative assessment results (grammar accuracy, lexical diversity, expressive fluency)",
    "Learners design quality maintenance mechanisms (monitoring/coaching/support) for large-scale language learning environments (100+ learners), set at least three language learning quality indicators (e.g., discussion participation ≥80%, pronunciation satisfaction ≥4.0/5.0, writing completion rate ≥90%), and propose implementable solutions within six months"
