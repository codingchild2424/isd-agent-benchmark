    "Learners, working in groups of four, will complete a digital content prototype (e.g., educational app/web interface) linked to industry contexts within one week and submit a final product that meets at least three of the five evaluation criteria through a prototype demonstration and functional explanation (5 minutes) at the final presentation. This process must adhere to media ethics and data safety protocols.",
    "Learners will select three latest media trends (e.g., AI-generated content, short-form video platforms), write a data-driven analysis report (approx. 1,000 characters), and create a 5-minute presentation. They must receive a grade of 'B+' or higher from at least two out of three peer evaluators. The analysis must consider cultural diversity and global media relations."
