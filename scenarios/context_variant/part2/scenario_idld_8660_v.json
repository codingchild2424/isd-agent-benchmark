    "Learners participate in three or more lesson study cycles during a six-month course, write three reflective journals comparing traditional approaches (e.g., lecture-based instruction, teacher-centered explanations) with alternative methods (e.g., collaborative learning, inquiry-based learning, social interaction enhancement strategies) in math lesson design, and derive at least two improvement plans through peer evaluation and expert feedback",
    "Propose three or more math lesson strategies promoting learner engagement and self-directed discovery (e.g., social constructivist activities, culturally contextualized problem-solving, civic competency enhancement projects)",
    "Collaboratively derive lesson improvement plans with peer teachers, document them via an LMS, and implement relationship-building strategies for forming an educational community"
