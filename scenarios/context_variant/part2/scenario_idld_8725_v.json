    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A short-term intensive course for mathematics education professionals to strengthen their competency in designing CT (Computational Thinking) experiential activities for young children. Emphasizes the mathematical foundations of CT (sequencing, conditionals, repetition) and focuses on designing activities applicable in real educational settings.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners design three non-computer-based CT (Computational Thinking) activities for preschoolers (ages 3-5) (sequential problem-solving, pattern recognition, conditional classification), produce 10-minute demonstration videos for each, and achieve \"excellent\" ratings in four of five expert evaluation rubric items.",
    "Develop two CT teaching strategies based on Embodied Cognition theory (algorithm understanding through physical activity, mathematical pattern recognition games).",
    "Learners complete a PBL project (simple automation script development) applying algorithmic thinking (conditional/loop statements) and debugging (log analysis, error handling) within one week, achieve ≥70 points on an evaluation rubric (40% functionality, 30% code readability, 30% debugging efficiency), and include mathematical computation elements (operations, comparisons, iterative patterns) in the design."
