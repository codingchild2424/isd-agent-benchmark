    "Learners can write a proposal for a mathematics project related to the SDGs by applying the five stages of design thinking (empathize - define - ideate - prototype - test).",
    "Learners, organized into 4-person teams, select one community sustainability issue (e.g., waste segregation efficiency or energy-saving measures), collect data using three or more methods (e.g., surveys, field measurements), and build mathematical models using linear/nonlinear functions. Based on this, they complete a PBL report (10+ pages) or presentation (15-minute duration) within a 6-month course, achieving over 80% in four of five rubric criteria."
