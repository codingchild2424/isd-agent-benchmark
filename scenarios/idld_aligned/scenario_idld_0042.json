  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic biology and medical terminology comprehension, fundamental smartphone proficiency, foundational medical text reading and vocabulary analysis skills, and introductory knowledge of traditional medicine vocabulary (e.g., herbal ingredients, prescriptions)",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learners access augmented reality (AR) content via smartphones, concurrently analyzing ethnic medicine literature and conducting lexical studies. Perform community-based projects using online collaboration tools (e.g., Google Workspace) without face-to-face activities. Focus on improving reading comprehension (specialized text analysis), expressive skills (report writing), and cultural text interpretation (understanding traditional language patterns).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Critically analyze ethnic medicine literature to explain the utilization principles of key medicinal plants by combining scientific terminology (e.g., antibacterial activity, biochemical mechanisms) with cultural contexts (traditional linguistic expressions, regional folklore, etc.).",
    "Using AR simulation tools (e.g., Labster, zSpace), learners can design virtual experiments to verify the antibacterial effects of three medicinal plants (e.g., green tea, aloe, eucalyptus), calculate antibacterial activity (%) based on simulation data, and interpret results within 500 characters, considering scientific evidence (research data, statistical analysis) and linguistic clarity (use of technical terms, logical structure).",
    "In a community-tailored ethnic medicine product development project, learners can produce a text-based output (product manual or research report) of over 10 pages integrating cultural contexts (local traditions, language habits, dialects) and scientific evidence (research papers, clinical data). The final output must achieve 4+ points (5-point scale) on an expert evaluation rubric: clarity, cultural appropriateness, scientific validity, practicality, and linguistic accuracy."
