Metrics include spatial efficiency, user satisfaction, and cultural appropriateness.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners create an interior design plan considering community context and quantitatively analyze spatial efficiency using scientific observation methods and variable control.",
    "Within one week, learners propose two communication strategies for conflict resolution and consensus-building in a collaborative simulation involving three residents and two NGO representatives. They receive \"Effective\" or higher feedback from four out of five peer evaluators. Throughout the process, they apply variable control and evidence-based approaches in experimental design to make data-driven decisions.",
    "Learners can propose spatial design solutions reflecting cultural sensitivity and receive evaluations through scientific analysis based on experimental data (user feedback, spatial efficiency metrics)."
