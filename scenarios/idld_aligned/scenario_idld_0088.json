  "title": "Digital Education Reflective Practice Strategies in the Pandemic Era: Educational Innovation for Strengthening Civic Competencies in Socio-Historical Contexts",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic proficiency in using digital education platforms, experience in primary education settings, understanding of educational paradigm shifts due to social change, and experience in designing civic engagement and community collaboration projects.",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Requires content optimized for smartphone-based learning environments. Practice-oriented education for in-service elementary teachers, emphasizing educational strategies to address social relationship changes caused by the pandemic. Content design must consider regional culture and economic conditions (e.g., project-based learning incorporating local history/cultural resources, strengthening vocational education linked to regional industry characteristics)",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Analyze digital education cases from the pandemic within sociohistorical contexts and derive three institutional improvement plans (e.g., building community cooperation systems to address digital divides).",
    "Design citizen-participatory problem-solving processes in educational settings using reflection-in-action techniques (e.g., student-resident collaboration projects for local issue resolution).",
    "Within six months, learners can develop a blended online learning plan for 20 vocational trainees in ≤50Mbps internet environments, meeting the following: 1) production/distribution of five 10-minute video lectures, 2) operation of two 30-minute live video sessions, 3) design of three text-based collaborative activities (forums/chats). Additionally, achieve over 80% learning engagement (based on attendance + activity logs) and ≥4.0 satisfaction survey scores (5-point scale), with the curriculum including one community-linked project (e.g., digital marketing tasks for local economic revitalization)."
