    "prior_knowledge": "Basic language learning experience (grammar systems, academic vocabulary, text comprehension) and ability to use digital learning tools (collaboration platforms, portfolio creation tools)",

    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learners use VLE toolkits (mind maps, feedback templates, rubrics) to visualize and share learning processes. Under peer feedback (grammar, vocabulary, expression) and instructor coaching (learning strategies, content deepening), they complete projects (text analysis, creative expression). All activities are designed to integrate and enhance language skills (reading, writing, listening, speaking).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Using the SOLE model, learners establish three self-directed language learning plans (focused on advanced reading, academic writing, practical conversation), produce digital portfolios documenting execution results, and systematically reflect on the learning process",
    "Using VLE-based collaboration tools (Padlet, Google Docs), learners provide peers with feedback on grammar correction, vocabulary expansion, and expressive enhancement in learning design processes, generating qualitative interaction records of five or more instances",
    "Over 1–6 months, learners complete a language learning project (cultural comparison presentation or digital storytelling), achieving ≥80% proficiency standards in speaking (5-minute presentation), writing (1,000-character academic essay), and listening (10-minute audio analysis), while performing peer evaluations (4+/5 points from 3 evaluators) and self-evaluations (meeting 4/5 rubric items). Project outputs must include text structure analysis, creative expression, and contextual reading elements"
