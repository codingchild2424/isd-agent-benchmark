    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",

    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Operates a language teaching methodology course for pre-service/in-service teachers at local learning centers, combining MOOCs with local study circles. In a digital device-provided environment, it integrates asynchronous online learning (utilizing writing feedback systems and pronunciation analysis tools) with offline collaboration (role-play workshops for expressive skills enhancement and discussion-based grammar practice).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners complete 80% or more of language teaching methodology content (grammar/vocabulary instruction strategies, text analysis techniques, communication strategies) on a MOOC platform.",
    "Learners present practical lesson design plans (including integrated reading-writing activities and pronunciation correction techniques) twice weekly in offline discussions through study circle activities.",
    "In a blended environment (online collaboration tools + face-to-face workshops), learners develop three types of educational materials (videos, quizzes, worksheets) meeting four or more of five peer evaluation rubric criteria (pedagogical appropriateness, linguistic accuracy, creativity, cultural relevance, learner engagement). They share the materials on an internal corporate platform and receive peer feedback averaging 4 points or higher (5-point scale)."
