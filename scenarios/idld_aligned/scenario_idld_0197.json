    "Analyze clinical data of DKA patients to express blood glucose and ketone level change patterns using differential equations and regression models, and establish an optimal initial response strategy.",
    "Apply priority management protocols for six DKA cases in a simulation environment using probability distribution and Monte Carlo simulation techniques.",
    "Utilize systems of linear equations and time-series graph analysis techniques for real-time treatment decisions (test requests, medication administration, etc.) based on individual patient data.",
    "Using simulation feedback data, learners create a self-management plan consisting of three stages (self-diagnosis, goal setting, action plan), share it with team members, and revise it after incorporating feedback. Additionally, they interpret statistical significance verification results (t-test or ANOVA) for collected data samples at a p-value threshold of 0.05, and calculate confidence intervals and effect sizes."
