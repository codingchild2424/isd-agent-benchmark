    "prior_knowledge": "Basic public health knowledge and experience in emergency response, foundational language education design (teaching methodologies and assessment tools), and experience in teaching basic grammar, vocabulary, and expressive skills",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Pre-service/in-service teachers strengthen their ability to design disaster preparedness simulations applicable to language education domains (grammar, vocabulary, expressive skills). Emphasis is placed on developing language learning materials usable in real classroom environments. Specific pedagogical methods include AR/VR-based situational communication training, multimodal text analysis activities, and role-playing for improving expressive skills.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can achieve ≥80% goal completion rate within 60 minutes in a bioterrorism scenario escape game using teamwork and problem-solving strategies, applying crisis communication strategies (clarity, conciseness, empathetic expression) to language education contexts.",
    "Learners can explain 3 design principles (interactivity, contextuality, challenge) for escape games combining digital tools (AR/VR platforms) and physical puzzles (3D puzzles, cipher devices), and create 2 templates for integrated language learning activities (scenario-based role-play, multimodal text analysis) evaluated by peers on clarity, creativity, and feasibility.",
    "Learners can meet team collaboration efficiency metrics (e.g., ≥85% participation, idea contribution frequency) through formative assessments and propose improvement plans reflecting language education effectiveness analysis (grammar accuracy, lexical diversity, expressive fluency gains)."
