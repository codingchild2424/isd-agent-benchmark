    "prior_knowledge": "Intermediate language proficiency (integrated reading, listening, speaking, writing) and understanding of basic professional terminology (medical/legal/business). Basic ability to utilize digital resources (experience with language learning apps and online dictionaries).",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learners use personal devices (tablets/smartphones) to access digital resources (language learning apps, online dictionaries, video materials) required for quest completion and collaborate with peers via real-time video conferencing tools. The program provides customized text analysis tools and vocabulary expansion features for specific professional fields, focusing on improving reading comprehension and expressive skills.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will demonstrate situational language application skills (integrated speaking/writing and specialized terminology) by successfully completing 80% or more of quests based on real-world professional scenarios (medical/legal contexts).",
    "By collaboratively designing and executing three or more customized language challenges with peers, learners will enhance creative problem-solving, collaborative expression, and domain-specific text analysis skills.",
    "Based on self-directed learning records (one or more entries per week for grammar/vocabulary/pronunciation and three or more specialized terms) over four weeks, learners will write a 1,000-character report analyzing changes in language proficiency. They must achieve a \"Distinguished\" grade (4+/5-point scale) in four out of five reflective rubric items (writing, presentation, feedback, participation, self-assessment)."
