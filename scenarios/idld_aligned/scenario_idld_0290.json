    "Graduate students design three types of science curriculum assessment tools (lab report, project evaluation, portfolio assessment) considering inclusive educational environments. They submit design documents reflecting fairness (reviewing at least three cultural bias items) and diversity (incorporating at least two multimodal expression methods) and achieve an 80% or higher fulfillment rate in peer and instructor reviews.",
    "Learners apply UDL (Universal Design for Learning) principles (providing multiple means of engagement, representation, action, and expression) to create a 4-week blended learning plan including three or more science lab activities. They provide feedback achieving an \"Excellent\" rating in four out of five peer assessment rubric items.",
    "Learners develop an interactive 3D model visualizing one scientific concept (e.g., molecular structure or celestial motion) using AR/VR tools (Unity, Unreal Engine, etc.) and submit a validation report earning an average score of 4 or higher (on a 5-point scale) from five peer evaluators in accessibility and educational effectiveness (clarity, interactivity, learning utility)."
