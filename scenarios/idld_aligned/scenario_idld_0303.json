    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "In a BYOD environment, learners engage in individual simulation training and measure learning achievement through mathematical modeling (regression analysis, ANOVA) and project-based assessments. Learners are evaluated on technical proficiency through graph interpretation, data analysis, and formula application.",

    "Calculate and statistically validate the accuracy of ureteroscopy procedures to over 80% using quantitative data collected from virtual reality simulators.",
    "Analyze the success rate of stone removal techniques in simulation environments using probability distributions and confidence intervals, then establish optimization strategies to reduce error rates to 20% or below.",
    "Within one week, learners will collect simulation metric data (time, angle, force) and apply descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, variance) and t-tests/ANOVA to analyze performance gaps between individuals. They will identify three or more differences between the top 20% and bottom 20% groups, then propose improvement plans (adjusting training frequency, modifying feedback cycles) based on statistical significance (p-value < 0.05)."
