  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can design two or more activities where they use measurement tools to express the comparative relationship between two quantities as rational numbers.",
    "Learners can develop three mathematical modeling tasks emphasizing the proportional meaning of fractions based on objectification theory.",
    "Learners can create a lesson plan explaining the socioconstructivist characteristics of the rational number recognition process by incorporating peer feedback."
