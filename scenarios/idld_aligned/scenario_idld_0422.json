    "Learners understand statistics and data science pedagogy at the secondary education level and can effectively achieve learning objectives on online platforms using self-regulated learning strategies.",
    "Within four weeks, learners design one statistics education material (PDF or PPT, 10+ pages), implement two visualization tools (heatmap, scatter plot, etc.) using Python’s Matplotlib/Seaborn, and develop a data science activity module applying at least one data analysis framework (Pandas or TensorFlow) with real datasets (e.g., Kaggle open data). The module must score 70+ points on an instructor rubric (40% design completeness, 30% technical applicability, 30% analytical effectiveness).",
    "Learners analyze their own learning experiences using personalization tools (progress tracking, customized recommendations) on online platforms, derive three or more optimization strategies, and write a 5-page report including concrete implementation plans (e.g., weekly learning templates, feedback system design) applicable to secondary classroom settings."
