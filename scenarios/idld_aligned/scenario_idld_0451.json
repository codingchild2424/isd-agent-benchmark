    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",

    "Learners improve language task performance (reading comprehension, writing, expression, vocabulary usage) by 20% through a systematic learning process based on Gagné’s Nine Events of Instruction.",
    "Apply Briggs’ Task Analysis Model to systematically solve complex language problems (text analysis, logical structuring, creative expression, contextual reasoning) by explaining at least three strategies.",
    "Learners select three of Wager’s Message Design Principles (goal setting, content structuring, visual integration) to complete a digital storytelling or interactive poster project using Canva or Google Slides. The final product must achieve at least 70 points in both peer evaluation (30% creativity, 40% principle application, 30% completion) and instructor evaluation (same criteria). The project must reflect grammatical accuracy and lexical diversity."
