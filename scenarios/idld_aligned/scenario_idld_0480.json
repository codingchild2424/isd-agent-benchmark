    "Learners design knowledge transfer models between ≥3 network status datasets (e.g., traffic patterns, latency, packet loss rates) using transfer learning techniques (fine-tuning, feature extraction). They submit technical reports meeting ≥2 of the predefined metrics (accuracy ≥80%, F1-score ≥0.75).",
    "Develop agents that simultaneously handle routing, modulation, spectrum allocation (RMSA), and anycast service tasks via multi-task learning and linguistically express task-specific performance analysis results.",
    "Within 4 weeks, learners implement a hierarchical processing structure separating global state and task-specific state data for modular DRL agent design. They apply this to ≥3 task scenarios in OpenAI Gym, achieve ≥80% task success rates, and systematically document experimental results."
