    "Learners can compose a 500+ character essay that clearly conveys complex concepts in science topics.",
    "Learners can provide feedback on peers' scientific writing across three dimensions—grammar, structure, and content—using CMC tools",
    "Learners can improve their writing structuring ability by over 20% by analyzing expert feedback",
    "Learners can perform at least three interactive feedback dialogues in VR-based simulations"
