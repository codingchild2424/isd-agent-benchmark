  "title": "Analysis of Motivational Factors and Self-Regulated Learning Strategies for E-Learning-Based Practical Language Learning in the Hospitality Industry",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic e-learning tool experience, comprehension of hotel operational processes, foundational language skills (reading/writing/speaking), and understanding of basic hospitality vocabulary (check-in/out, reservation changes, etc.)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Conducted in a smartphone-centric limited-technology environment, this program analyzes hotel industry employees' e-learning-based language learning motivation in connection with self-regulated learning theory. Focuses on acquiring practical language expressions (grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation) and improving communication skills required in the workplace. Develops scenarios that simultaneously enhance learners' reading comprehension (understanding work documents) and expressive abilities (email writing, customer interaction).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will distinguish ≥3 \"push\" factors (organizational demands, evaluation systems) and \"pull\" factors (job utility, personal growth) influencing E-learning-based language learning (e.g., customer service expressions, business document writing) in hotel industry settings.",
    "Using self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies (goal setting, time management, self-assessment), learners will establish ≥3 language learning motivation management plans (e.g., expanding work-related vocabulary, reviewing grammar for hotel documents, practicing customer service pronunciation) in an E-learning course and record ≥80% execution via a weekly checklist.",
    "Through peer collaboration, learners will develop ≥1 E-learning-based language learning scenario applicable to hotel workplaces (e.g., English check-in/out dialogue simulation, email template development) integrating expressions (grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation) required in actual work contexts."
