    "Learners can implement multimodal (visual/auditory/text) composition processes within a group using ICT tools.",
    "Using digital feedback platforms (e.g., Google Docs, Notion), learners can develop initial composition ideas into two or more creative variations (e.g., rhythm pattern changes, instrument arrangement restructuring) based on feedback from three peers and complete a 3-minute composition draft",
    "Learners can evaluate the efficiency of smartphone-based composition applications in limited-technology settings."
