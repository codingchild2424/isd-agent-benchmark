  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can explain the application of software testing principles (boundary value analysis, equivalence partitioning, etc.) to mathematical models",
    "Learners can design and execute test cases for real-world projects using technological elements (test automation tools) of the TPACK framework",
    "In blended learning environments, learners can identify and improve over 80% of defects in testing projects through peer assessment and feedback systems"
