    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational science knowledge (physics, chemistry, biology), basic professional competencies, and understanding of scientific inquiry methods (observation, hypothesis formulation, experimental design, data analysis, conclusion drawing)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A blended environment combining smartphone-based mobile learning (virtual lab simulations) with offline workshops (field experiments). Learners, as non-degree-seeking adults, must acquire science competencies applicable to their jobs (data analysis, hypothesis verification, variable control) in a short period and make evidence-based decisions through the scientific inquiry process.",

    "learner_age": "In their 20s",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners design science-focused personalized learning pathways aligned with career goals and demonstrate the ability to verify hypotheses using experimental design and control of independent/dependent variables.",
    "Learners analyze three formal learning resources (institutional science textbooks, online lab lectures) and two informal resources (industry technical reports, scientist interviews) related to vocational training and submit an evidence-based personalized lifelong learning plan within one week.",
    "Learners apply self-directed learning strategies in mobile environments and analyze data using systematic observation and precision measurement techniques for scientific problem-solving."
