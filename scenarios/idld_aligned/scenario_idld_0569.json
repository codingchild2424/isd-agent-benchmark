  "title": "VR-Based Social Space Design Education: Future-Oriented Thinking and Practice in Urban Planning and Cultural Geography Perspectives",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic spatial composition principles and design elements, foundational knowledge of social space concepts and publicness, and comprehension of basic principles in urban planning and cultural geography.",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learners access a VR platform via personal devices (BYOD) to complete non-real-time tutorials, simulation tasks, and peer feedback activities. They analyze spatial design cases and share creative ideas on LMS discussion boards. Special emphasis is placed on comparative analysis of spatial design approaches from urban planning and cultural geography perspectives, exploring design solutions that reflect a community’s cultural characteristics and historical context",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Complete three or more design projects in a VR environment using 3D spatial modeling tools, incorporating social interaction elements (citizen participation, publicness, cultural context).",
    "Applying spatial cognition theory (hierarchical spatial structure, visual cues, etc.) and social relationship concepts, learners develop spatial design plans for three types of public spaces (e.g., children’s library, park, museum) and achieve a grade of ‘B’ (80–89 points) or higher in at least four of the five rubric items (creativity, functionality, accessibility, safety, aesthetics). Specifically, design plans must reflect cultural geography elements.",
    "Through peer evaluation and citizen participation workshops, learners improve and optimize two or more spatial design prototypes, incorporating requirements from diverse stakeholders (citizens, policymakers, local communities)."
