Emphasizes interactive activities to improve learners' expressive and reading skills. Particularly trains systematic processes for variable control and evidence-based conclusion drawing during text analysis, introducing case study methods to verify applicability in educational settings.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Within six months, learners can complete 12 mobile language education modules (vocabulary expansion, grammatical structures, text analysis, creative writing, critical reading) with over 85% completion and apply scientific inquiry methods (hypothesis formation-observation-analysis-conclusion) to each module",
    "Learners can analyze the structure and context of language education materials (texts, multimedia content) and achieve 90% accuracy in formative assessments on variable control and evidence-based evaluation skills",
    "Over six months, learners can complete three project-based assignments and develop two types of language instruction designs applicable to elementary or middle school settings (one writing activity design, one reading strategy development). Each design must pass peer evaluation (meeting 4 or more of 5 rubric items) and instructor evaluation (meeting 4 or more of 5 rubric items) and include case studies demonstrating applicability in real educational settings"
