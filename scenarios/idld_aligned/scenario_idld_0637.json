  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic machine learning concepts and foundational linear algebra, understanding of numerical representations of language data (e.g., TF-IDF, embeddings), and familiarity with basic grammar and text analysis terminology (e.g., tokenization, part-of-speech tagging).",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Practical language pattern analysis skills emphasized through hands-on training. Contextual analysis activities are integrated to enhance reading comprehension during computational practice with text data. Due to technological constraints, theoretical explanations highlight the connection between linguistic concepts (e.g., semantic ambiguity) and statistical modeling",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Explain the fundamental principles of tensor-based regression learning and comparatively analyze differences with ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) in terms of processing text structures and lexical usage patterns in linguistic data.",
    "Solve a simple regression problem by applying the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse calculation method for tensors to extract statistical patterns (e.g., word frequency distribution) from text data.",
    "Understand the process of integrating Type-2 fuzzy set concepts into tensor regression models and apply them to real-world linguistic data reflecting uncertainty (e.g., polysemy handling and context-dependent semantic interpretation)."
