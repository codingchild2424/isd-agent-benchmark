  "title": "Designing Online Mathematics Learning Motivation Strategies: Gamification and Problem-Solving Approaches Based on Self-Determination Theory",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic mathematical concepts (algebra, geometry, statistics, probability) and foundational pedagogical concepts, with basic proficiency in core mathematical skills such as solving equations, interpreting graphs, and analyzing data",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A pre-service teacher program focusing on developing math motivation strategies applicable in real classrooms. Includes case studies on visualizing problem-solving processes (using graphs/diagrams), error analysis (formula/calculation errors), and integrating gamification elements (scoring systems, level design). Cultivate the ability to develop immediately usable math teaching/learning materials.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Design at least three strategies for applying the three elements of Self-Determination Theory (autonomy, competence, relatedness) to an online mathematics learning environment (e.g., adaptive difficulty adjustment system, peer-collaborative proof problems, personalized feedback graphs and formula analysis tools).",
    "Learners can design two motivational activities incorporating at least two gamification elements (e.g., point acquisition, level-up, leaderboard) into the mathematics problem-solving process within three weeks, achieving an average satisfaction score of 4 or higher on a 5-point scale from peer evaluations and instructor feedback. (Activity design must reflect specific math problem types such as equation solving or graph interpretation.)",
    "Learners must engage in at least three social interactions using a peer feedback system (e.g., proof-sharing platform, error analysis discussion board) in a blended environment, provide two or more feedback instances on peers’ proof problems, and generate one question related to error analysis on the discussion board. (Feedback must address specific mathematical concepts such as statistical errors or geometric proof errors.)",
    "Learners can create a motivation-maintenance portfolio (minimum three projects) documenting the mathematics problem-solving process over two weeks and achieve an \"excellent\" rating in at least four out of five evaluation rubric categories (clarity of topic, logical coherence, creativity, completeness, presentation skills) during a 5-minute presentation. (The portfolio must include problem-solving steps, graph visualizations, and statistical analysis materials.)"
