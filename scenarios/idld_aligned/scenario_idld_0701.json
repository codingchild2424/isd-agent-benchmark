  "learning_goals": [
    "By applying the five phases of the 5E model (Engage-Explore-Explain-Extend-Evaluate), learners can systematically structure mathematics instructional design processes",
    "Using AI chatbot scaffolding, learners can derive at least three instructional strategies (e.g., inquiry, modeling, problem-solving) suitable for mathematics classroom activities",
    "By reflecting on formative assessment feedback, learners can revise and improve their instructional designs, and enhance final outputs through peer evaluation and comprehensive teacher assessment"
