    "prior_knowledge": "Introductory library usage experience and basic understanding of social science research methodologies (e.g., literature analysis, variable control, civic engagement strategies)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",

    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A practice-oriented education program to improve current practitioners' academic information search and utilization skills, linked to social science research design (establishing research questions, data collection strategies). Particularly focuses on practical application cases such as policy analysis, industry trend research, and cultural impact assessment, emphasizing information utilization strategies from the perspectives of civic rights and social responsibility.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can explain methodologies for efficiently searching academic libraries’ databases and electronic resources tailored to social science research topics (e.g., policy analysis, industry trends).",
    "Learners select three academic sources related to a corporate research topic, evaluate them based on credibility (author/source), recency (within 5 years), and relevance (80%+ topic alignment), and write a one-page report analyzing strengths (2), weaknesses (2), and limitations (1). The report must include 150+ characters of critical analysis considering social contexts (industry trends, stakeholder impacts, cultural factors).",
    "Learners collaborate with two peers using the ICE framework (Impact, Confidence, Ease) to analyze three or more social science information types (market trends, consumer behavior data, cultural influences) and write a one-page interdisciplinary strategy report (economics + psychology + sociology) within a week."
