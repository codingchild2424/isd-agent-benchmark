    "Explain fundamental algorithm concepts through unplugged activities and cultivate social relationship and civic engagement skills for solving real-life problems.",
    "Learners design a collaborative project in teams of 3–4, using play robots to solve real-life problems (e.g., recycling sorting), create presentation materials applying three principles of digital citizenship (privacy protection, collaborative etiquette, respect for cultural diversity, etc.), and achieve an average score of 4 or higher on a peer evaluation (5-point scale).",
    "Through a computer science interest assessment by field (theory/applied), learners diagnose their individual career direction and explore connections between future job markets and potential societal contributions."
