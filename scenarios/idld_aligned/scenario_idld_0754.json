Particular emphasis on systematizing linguistic representations of core concepts such as \"nets\" and \"unit conversions.\"",

    "Learners can explain the principles of calculating surface areas of rectangular prisms, cubes, prisms, and pyramids using mathematical terms (e.g., \"net,\" \"unit area\") and linguistic expressions (e.g., \"multiply the base area by the height\") with instructional videos.",
    "Learners can reproduce step-by-step problem-solving processes through video tutorials using visual and linguistic expressions (e.g., \"describing formula application,\" \"explaining unit conversion\") and systematically articulate core concepts (e.g., \"surface area components\").",
    "Learners can establish a self-directed learning plan (30 minutes/day, 5 days/week) on a mobile learning platform, achieve over 80% adherence for 4 weeks, and write reflective entries in a learning journal using mathematical terms (e.g., \"unit conversion,\" \"formula derivation\") and concepts (e.g., \"principles of surface area composition\")."
