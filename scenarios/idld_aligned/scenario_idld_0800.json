    "Learners can self-direct the learning of mathematical concepts using digital content provided in a flipped learning environment.",
    "In a blended learning environment (online collaboration tools + face-to-face sessions), learners form teams of 3–4 members, select one real-life problem (e.g., local environmental improvement, budget management), and write and present a project report proposing solutions using mathematical modeling (statistical analysis, optimization techniques, etc.). Evaluation is based on a rubric: problem definition clarity (20%), appropriateness of mathematical approach (30%), feasibility (25%), and creativity (25%).",
    "Using AI-based tools (Desmos, GeoGebra, Wolfram Alpha, etc.), learners visualize three or more given mathematical problems, analyze the generated graphs/data, and write a report explaining the problem-solving process in five stages (problem definition, modeling, simulation, result interpretation, verification).",
    "In a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) environment, learners compare five or more digital tools (sensors, apps, cloud platforms, etc.) for three given science experiment scenarios and propose an optimal tool combination strategy that meets experimental purpose, budget, and compatibility criteria.",
    "Learners achieve over 80% proficiency in summative evaluations of project-based outcomes."
