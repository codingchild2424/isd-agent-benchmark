  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Introductory digital tool experience, foundational educational concepts, linguistic basics (grammar structures, text types, communication strategies), and required multimodal text interpretation skills and mobile environment adaptability",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course focusing on enhancing the efficiency and immersion of language learning (reading, writing, speaking) by leveraging the interactive affordances of digital learning materials in smartphone-centric limited-technology environments. Particularly emphasizes designing language learning activities optimized for mobile environments, including strategies to improve expressive and reading skills through voice input and visual feedback.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can design three or more language learning activities (integrated reading-writing, vocabulary expansion, expression practice) that reflect digital media characteristics (multimodal text, interactivity). Special emphasis is placed on text structure analysis and the application of communication strategies.",
    "Analyze educational affordances (touch gestures, voice input, visual feedback) in smartphone-based environments and develop design proposals for language learning materials (dialogue simulations, grammar exercises, writing tools). Focus on improving expressive skills through speech recognition and vocabulary mapping features.",
    "Validate the effectiveness of digital language learning materials (vocabulary acquisition rate, grammatical accuracy, expressive improvement) using formative assessment tools (quiz apps, feedback systems). Implement evaluation procedures including text-generation ability and reading comprehension accuracy metrics."
