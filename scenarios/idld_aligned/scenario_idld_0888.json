    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of advanced mathematical concepts (functions, calculus, probability/statistics) and educational methodologies, knowledge of high school mathematics curriculum structures, experience with computational tools (calculators, spreadsheets), and foundational skills in solving equations, analyzing graphs, and processing statistical data",

    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course where pre-service/in-service teachers internalize constructivist approaches (inquiry-based learning, discovery learning) and collaborative learning strategies (role division, peer assessment) necessary for designing real high school mathematics technology curricula. Special emphasis is placed on cultivating mathematical modeling and real-life problem-solving skills, with technology-integrated education specializing in VR tools for equation visualization, probability simulations, and graph analysis.",

    "Graduate students design high school mathematics curricula (equation modeling, graph visualization, probability simulation) using virtual reality (VR) and multimedia tools (GeoGebra, Unity, etc.) and submit an instructional design plan meeting: 1) integration of ≥3 VR/multimedia tools, 2) design of ≥5 learning activities, 3) ≥7/10 points on an expert evaluation rubric. The plan must include activities enhancing equation-solving, graph interpretation, and probabilistic reasoning skills.",
    "Learners select ≥3 historical technological advancements in mathematics (e.g., calculus development, cryptography evolution, computational tool transitions), analyze them in humanistic, engineering, and pedagogical contexts, and submit a 10–15-page mathematics education material development plan. The analysis must include derivation processes, problem-solving strategies, and statistical modeling cases.",
    "Graduate students develop three learner-centered project-based assessment tools (problem-solving portfolio, proof process rubric, statistical analysis rubric) in collaborative learning environments and submit a final report reflecting peer feedback (≥3 reviewers) and instructor evaluation (meeting ≥4/5 rubric criteria). The tools must measure computational accuracy, graph interpretation, and probabilistic thinking."
