    "Learners analyze online educational experiences through peer dialogue using the Collaborative Autoethnography (CAE) methodology",
    "Learners identify three social constraints (digital divide, social isolation, decreased learning motivation) and three material constraints (equipment shortage, internet accessibility, unstable power supply) arising during the transition to online education, and write a 1,500-character report proposing two feasible alternatives per constraint. The report must achieve an \"excellent\" grade in at least two of three rubric criteria (clarity, feasibility, creativity)."
