  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational agronomy theories, practical agricultural experience, basic understanding of sustainable agricultural systems, and foundational knowledge of community institutions",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Simulation/VR-based",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Establish a digital education environment integrating theory and practice. Design education reflecting cultural and economic contexts (local history, political structures) through grassland management case studies linked to local communities. Foster civic consciousness and curriculum innovation via learner collaboration.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can design scenarios incorporating grass science theory and the social impacts of sustainable agricultural systems (citizen rights, community relations) using the 6-step BOPPPS model (preparation, objectives, engagement, explanation, practice, summary).",
    "Learners can improve practical problem-solving skills by over 80% in simulation/VR environments, considering economic efficiency and environmental sustainability (resource circulation, carbon emission reduction) of virtual experiments on feed processing and storage.",
    "Learners can develop a feed management system prototype in teams (3–5 members) over four weeks and demonstrate innovation application capabilities and social contributions (local economic activation, cultural suitability) by meeting evaluation criteria: local resource utilization (30% functionality), technological innovation (40% novelty), and field applicability (30% practicality) with a total score of over 80 points."
