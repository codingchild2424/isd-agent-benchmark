  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic digital tool proficiency, foundational science subject knowledge and understanding of experimental design/observation/measurement/evidence analysis, experience with the scientific inquiry process (hypothesis formulation → variable control → data collection → conclusion drawing)",

    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Customized for science teachers, this program uses mixed methodologies and constructivist approaches to overcome online learning limitations, strengthen digital learning identities, and develop scientific inquiry skills (observation, measurement, analysis, evidence-based conclusions).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Understand the operational principles of micro-credential systems and develop utilization plans linked to scientific inquiry processes (experiment design, hypothesis verification, variable control)",
    "In a constructivist online learning environment (Google Workspace, Padlet, etc.), learners collaborate with 3–5 peers to design and execute a project (e.g., science experiment portfolio website, learning journal blog) over 8 weeks for strengthening digital learning identity, and submit deliverables (experiment data analysis, scientific argumentation, etc.) meeting three or more of four peer evaluation and instructor feedback criteria",
    "Through LMS-based project outputs, acquire three or more micro-credentials proving teachers’ online inquiry-based instructional competencies (e.g., virtual experiment design, data analysis, scientific argumentation, evidence-based conclusion drawing)"
