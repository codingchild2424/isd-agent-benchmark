    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "In a virtual simulation environment mimicking real port operations, learners acquire operating techniques for various crane types and solve actual work scenarios in project units. This includes Monte Carlo simulations considering probabilistic variables (weather conditions, equipment failures) and integer programming (IP) for optimizing work sequences.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "By the end of the six-month course, learners will model operational parameters (work speed, movement paths, energy consumption) of Quay-Side Gantry and Rubber Tired Gantry cranes using simulation tools (e.g., AnyLogic). Applying linear programming and optimization algorithms, they will achieve at least a 15% improvement in operational efficiency.",
    "Enhance proficiency in linear programming (LP) modeling for efficient container loading/unloading operations and deriving optimal solutions under constraints.",
    "Analyze real-time performance data (probability distributions, statistical significance testing) using simulation-based auto-evaluation systems and improve work processes."
