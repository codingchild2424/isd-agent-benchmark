  "title": "Educational Blogging to Enhance Reflective Learning in Computer-Assisted Language Education: Focused on Text Analysis and Clarity of Expression",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Experience with computer-assisted instructional tools, foundational language education concepts (grammar/vocabulary systems, text analysis methods), experience teaching languages to elementary learners, and basic understanding of reflective practice frameworks",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Professional development for medical/legal/technical experts to strengthen elementary language education competencies. Emphasize real-time interaction and reflective learning activities using mobile devices in BYOD environments. Operate personalized feedback systems to enhance learners' expressive skills (writing/speaking) and reading comprehension (reading/critical reading). Include diagnostic functionality for language usage patterns using text-based analysis tools.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can write three educational blog posts on computer-assisted language learning (CALL) experiences within a week, systematically apply four or more stages of the Reflective Practice framework (description, reflection, analysis, evaluation, action plan), and achieve over 80% peer feedback satisfaction. Specifically, they analyze grammar/vocabulary usage patterns in language education contexts and derive pedagogical implications of text structuring.",
    "Learners can successfully complete over 80% of projects applying language education knowledge to new instructional contexts based on reflective thinking. This includes developing action plans based on reading/writing instruction experiences in educational settings and improving vocabulary diversity.",
    "Learners can demonstrate qualitative improvements (e.g., text structuring, vocabulary diversity, clarity of expression) in blogging content through peer feedback twice or more and strengthen critical reading skills for evaluating peers’ writing feedback."
