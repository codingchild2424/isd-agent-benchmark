    "Students can perform the five-step hypothesis testing process (problem definition, hypothesis formulation, significance level determination, test statistic calculation, conclusion) with 80% or higher accuracy through game-based tasks",
    "Learners can correct errors within three attempts using gamification feedback (e.g., scores, progress bars) and improve statistical thinking",
    "Teams present and evaluate results of applying hypothesis testing to real-world social issues (e.g., health data analysis) through project-based activities"
