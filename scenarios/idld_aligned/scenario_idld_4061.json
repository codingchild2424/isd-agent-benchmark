  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners document the process of solving mathematical problems using real public data and improve their outcomes by at least 80% by incorporating peer feedback.",
    "Learners select and comparatively analyze reliable data from three or more sources (National Statistical Office, local government reports, academic papers).",
    "Through team projects, learners derive mathematical conclusions and present them as visual materials (e.g., infographics) understandable to non-experts."
