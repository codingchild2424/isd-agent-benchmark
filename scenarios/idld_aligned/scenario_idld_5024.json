  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners perform real-time feedback with team members at least three times while drafting a math paper using collaborative web-based tools and develop document version control skills.",
    "Learners design an efficient collaboration process by maintaining a 7:3 strategic usage ratio between text space (content organization) and interface (tool functionality) in online collaborative environments.",
    "Learners compile asynchronous communication records among team members during math research paper writing into a portfolio and reflect them in the introduction-methods-results structure of the final paper."
