  "learning_goals": [
    "Core concepts of organizational learning theory (first/second-order learning, single/double-loop learning) can be accurately linked to mathematical education contexts",
    "Cognitive barriers in mathematical education settings can be analyzed, and three or more unlearning strategies to address them can be designed",
    "A dynamic learning-unlearning process can be experienced through PBL, and a concrete action plan to innovate existing educational practices can be established"
