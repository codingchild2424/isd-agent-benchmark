    "It is possible to distinguish and explain at least three types of cognitive, emotional, and physical loads occurring in synchronous hybrid educational settings.",
    "Learners can identify three applicable factors (among the six major factors: students, teachers, design, policy, technology, environment) that increase Teacher Orchestration Load (TOL) in their own context.",
    "Learners can propose at least two specific strategies (e.g., role distribution, technology tool utilization) to reduce orchestration load in hybrid classes."
