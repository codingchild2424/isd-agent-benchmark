  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners analyze engineering text materials provided in a flipped learning environment and can linguistically and conceptually explain five core concepts with over 80% accuracy.",
    "Through collaborative activities, learners apply three technical documentation skills (writing, presentation, discussion) required for engineering problem-solving processes as linguistic communication tools.",
    "In a BYOD environment, learners use digital tools to submit engineering design process outcomes in technical report format with 90% completeness."
