    "Learners can develop text-based analysis capabilities for science classroom creativity assessment tools based on nine elements (cognitive/affective characteristics, class participation, classroom environment, teacher support, individual/group creative behaviors).",
    "Learners can interpret creativity data collected in a simulation environment to propose three or more personalized instructional design strategies and link them to language expression activities.",
    "Learners can develop creativity-promoting instructional models through project-based assessment and improve them using language feedback techniques during peer evaluation."
