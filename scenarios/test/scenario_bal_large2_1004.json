  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational sports education theories and understanding of team sports training methods, basic concepts of social interaction and collaborative learning, experience utilizing community resources (e.g., park facilities)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Focused on exploring methods for applying Parkour training elements in actual physical education classes, this course particularly emphasizes improving adolescents' social skills and spatial awareness. It considers the scalability of utilizing local community resources (e.g., park facilities) and includes strategies to encourage participation from learners with diverse cultural backgrounds.",
    "institution_type": "University (undergraduate)",
    "learner_age": "In their 30s",
    "learner_education": "Elementary",
    "learner_role": "Professional (medical/legal/technical)",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Propose ≥3 concrete strategies (e.g., obstacle courses using local park facilities, space-utilizing cooperative games) to apply Parkour’s core principles (overcoming obstacles, spatial awareness) to physical education classes and present each strategy’s educational effects (improved body control, spatial cognition, social relationship formation) within 5 minutes",
    "Design Parkour-based training programs using a learner-centered approach, incorporating role distribution among team members and social interaction strategies (communication, conflict management, leadership)",
    "In 4-person small groups, learners develop one Parkour-based lesson scenario, provide ≥2 specific peer feedbacks according to a rubric (creativity, cultural diversity reflection, feasibility), revise the scenario incorporating feedback, and submit the final version. This process considers fostering cooperative abilities and community consciousness as citizens"
