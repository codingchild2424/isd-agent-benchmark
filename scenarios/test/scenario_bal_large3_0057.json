  "title": "Constructivist-Based Geography Inquiry Project: Learner-Centered Language-Geography Integrated Education Using Digital Resources",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic geographic concepts, digital device proficiency, foundational grammar and logical writing skills, academic text structure comprehension, and basic vocabulary application",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "For practical geography learning aligned with national assessment systems, an online environment integrating digital libraries and collaboration tools is structured. Language learning elements (grammar accuracy, vocabulary diversity, text structuring) are incorporated to improve learners' reading/writing skills. Peer evaluation particularly assesses linguistic expression abilities and critical thinking simultaneously.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can derive 3+ case studies of causal relationships between geographical phenomena through linguistic analysis (vocabulary selection, sentence structure, logical connections) and explain them using academic expressions.",
    "Learners will select 3+ regions using digital geography tools (Google Earth, Naver Maps), comparatively analyze environmental characteristics (climate, topography, vegetation), write structured project reports (introduction-body-conclusion), present within 5 minutes, and achieve \"excellent\" ratings in 3+ of 5 peer evaluation rubric items (content organization, clarity of expression, visual effects, vocabulary diversity, grammatical accuracy).",
    "Learners will draft map analysis reports incorporating feedback from 3 peers via online collaboration tools (Google Docs, Padlet), linguistically restructure 2+ feedback points (synonym substitution, sentence restructuring, grammatical corrections), and include them in the final report."
