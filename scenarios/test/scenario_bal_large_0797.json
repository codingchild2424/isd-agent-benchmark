  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic digital literacy, organizational management experience, foundational understanding of corporate culture/institutions, and elementary awareness of civic engagement and social relationship-building.",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "An offline environment focusing on smartphone-based learning tools, verifying practical application abilities through project-based assessments. It emphasizes improving social skills (inter-team communication, role distribution, conflict management). Case analyses considering historical, geographical, political, and economic contexts foster comprehensive civic awareness.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Cultivate the ability to diagnose social and organizational barriers (culture, systems, relationships) to technology adoption within enterprises by analyzing the four stages of the Instructional Technology Integration Life Cycle (ITILC): missing links, misdirection, weak areas, and key dilemmas.",
    "Learners can design three or more customized educational technology implementation plans reflecting their department’s cultural diagnostic results and civic awareness survey data (rights perception, institutional trust) using the five core elements of the ITD (Information-Technology-Instructional Design) 3D framework (information analysis, technology integration, instructional strategies, cultural assessment, civic engagement). They must achieve an average feedback score of 4 or higher on a 5-point scale from an internal expert evaluation panel.",
    "Learners collaborate with cross-departmental project teams (3–5 members) using Google Workspace or MS Teams, update documents/work products incorporating real-time feedback at least twice weekly, and achieve a score of 4 or higher on a 5-point scale in team collaboration efficiency evaluations within six months. This strengthens organizational relationships and institutional capabilities (conflict management, role distribution, communication protocol improvements)."
