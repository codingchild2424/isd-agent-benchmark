  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Core science curriculum knowledge (experimental design, data analysis, variable control) and elementary education experience, with comprehension of the scientific inquiry process (hypothesis formulation → experimentation → observation → analysis → conclusions).",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A blended approach combining smartphone-based mobile learning (science app utilization) with offline workshops (experimental observation activities). Strengthens scientific inquiry processes through a teacher-librarian collaboration model. Learners refine evidence collection and analysis skills in authentic experimental settings.",

    "learner_age": "40s and above",
    "learner_education": "Adult learner (non-degree)",
    "learner_role": "Office worker (administrative/management)",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can select reliable experimental and observational data from academic databases for science lesson design, emphasizing variable control and hypothesis verification in scientific inquiry activities.",
    "When developing elementary science materials, learners can apply a plagiarism-prevention citation checklist (5 items) with over 90% compliance, adhering to information ethics standards (Korea Copyright Commission guidelines). This includes clearly documenting measurement and analysis methods for experimental data, focusing on three variables (independent, dependent, and controlled) and hypothesis formulation.",
    "Learners can design science-integrated information literacy modules following the IDEA model phases and develop evidence-based assessment rubrics, which must include analysis of experimental results and the conclusion-drawing process."
