  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Grasp of fundamental mathematics concepts (fractions, equations, geometry) and foundational teaching knowledge, basic statistical analysis skills, and elementary understanding of graph interpretation and formula application",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Enhancing pre-service and in-service teachers' ability to design effective mathematics instruction in multilingual learning environments: particularly emphasizes visual representation strategies (graphs, formulas, proofs) to overcome linguistic barriers. Examples include using visual models for fraction operations, graph interpretation for equation solving, and shape decomposition in geometric proofs.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can apply IPA’s five-dimensional pedagogy (objectives, materials, activities, assessment, reflection) to design a 3–5-page lesson plan for mathematics instruction that incorporates three or more activities (solving equations, fraction operations, geometric proofs) reflecting linguistic contexts (e.g., multilingual math terminology comparison) and cultural contexts (e.g., real-life problem-solving examples).",
    "Learners can analyze and improve their teaching practices through a reflective cycle, utilizing practical tools such as error analysis, graph interpretation, and proof reconstruction.",
    "Learners can select three middle school-level math concepts (fraction operations, solving linear equations, geometric proofs) in multilingual settings (e.g., Spanish-English, Vietnamese-English), apply translation tools (Google Translate, DeepL) and mediation techniques (peer learning, visual aids) to create a 10-page interdisciplinary strategy document, achieving over 80% satisfaction in peer reviews and instructor feedback."
