  "title": "Mobile Social Media-Based University Language Education Design: Integrated Text, Vocabulary, and Expression Strategies with Scientific Analysis Application",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic mobile device usage and understanding of social media platforms, intermediate-level target language grammar and vocabulary knowledge, fundamental text analysis skills, and foundational understanding of scientific inquiry methods (observation, hypothesis formulation, evidence collection)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Students perform language learning activities using personal devices, with collaboration and content sharing facilitated via social media. The focus is on acquiring communication skills applicable to real-world settings (formal/informal expressions, cultural appropriateness) as job seekers. The goal is to improve effective expression and reading comprehension in global contexts, with measurable evidence (engagement logs, vocabulary usage statistics, interaction frequency) collected and analyzed throughout the learning process.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can select three or more language learning contents provided on mobile social media platforms such as WeChat and Instagram, analyze their text structure (paragraph organization, logical flow), vocabulary usage (frequency, appropriateness), and cultural context (background, implications) using scientific inquiry methods, and produce an evidence-based report achieving a grade of 'B+' or higher in at least three out of four evaluation rubric criteria: analytical depth, critical perspective, evidence presentation, and creativity.",
    "Learners can design one integrated mobile social media education case (reading, writing, and speaking) by applying case study and qualitative analysis methods (interviews, observations, content analysis), implement it for at least five actual learners over two weeks, and submit a performance report (participation rate ≥80%, learning effectiveness survey ≥4/5 points). Systematic measurement of changes in learners' reading comprehension and expressive skills is required.",
    "Within four weeks, learners can design three student-centered language learning activities (e.g., vocabulary quizzes, role-play videos, feedback discussions) using real-time feedback features and collaboration tools of mobile social media platforms (WeChat, Padlet, etc.), and propose strategies meeting effectiveness criteria (participation rate ≥80%, interaction frequency ≥10 times, vocabulary accuracy ≥90%) through peer evaluation and instructor verification. Experimental design considering variable control must be applied in activity planning."
