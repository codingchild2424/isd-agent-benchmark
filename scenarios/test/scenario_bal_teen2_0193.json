  "title": "[K-12] Program for Enhancing Social Studies History Exhibition Learning Effects Using Digital Learning Sheets: Exploring Cultural Contexts and Fostering Citizenship",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic comprehension of prior learning or digital learning tools, foundational social studies concepts (history, culture, citizenship), inquiry methods (observation, comparison, analysis), and awareness of community institutions",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Operated in a smartphone-based learning environment, this program incorporates project-based assessments (historical material analysis, cultural heritage interpretation) and activities aligned with social studies education standards (core competencies: critical thinking, collaborative problem-solving, citizenship). Learners analyze historical evidence and explore cultural relationships using digital tools, fostering awareness of civic rights.",
    "institution_type": "Vocational training institution",
    "learner_age": "Teens (13-19)",
    "learner_education": "Middle school",
    "learner_role": "Office worker (administrative/management)",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners enhance their learning motivation by over 20% using digital learning sheets linked to social studies history exhibition content, while strengthening their ability to understand cultural contexts and historical relationships.",
    "Learners analyze three application cases of the 'sensory exploration principle' presented in digital learning sheets, conduct a local history reconstruction project (e.g., school history timeline creation) following social studies inquiry methodology (observation-question-hypothesis-verification), and achieve a grade of 'B' (70+ points) or higher in at least four of the five evaluation rubric items. Through this, they develop historical thinking and data interpretation skills.",
    "Learners develop one self-assessment checklist to measure social studies cognitive and psychomotor learning outcomes (e.g., historical thinking, data interpretation skills) within a short-term vocational training course (within one week). They receive a score of 4+ points (on a 5-point scale) from two peer evaluators in the clarity (historical concept reflection) and practicality (field applicability) categories. This process cultivates collaborative problem-solving skills."
