  "title": "[K-12] Computer Model-Based Language Learning Design Project: Integrated Text and Speech Analysis Approach",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Comprehension of basic scientific theories, computer literacy, knowledge of fundamental grammar and vocabulary, general understanding of language learning processes, foundational text analysis skills, and conceptual awareness of speech recognition",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Supports personalized device usage and collaborative learning with continuous formative feedback. Highlights AI-driven real-time feedback systems (text mining, voice spectrum analysis), customized vocabulary recommendations (frequency/difficulty-based), and pronunciation correction (voice waveform comparison). Learning portfolios track growth in reading/writing proficiency.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Cultivating the ability to analyze correlations between variables in language learning curricula (e.g., vocabulary acquisition patterns, pronunciation analysis, text structure) using computer models that explain scientific phenomena.",
    "Learners apply a three-stage framework (problem definition → model development → validation) to design modeling-based PBL (Problem-Based Learning) projects. Over four weeks, teams develop prototypes solving real language learning problems (e.g., vocabulary acquisition, pronunciation correction, contextual understanding) and achieve ≥80% completion rates in peer and instructor evaluations. During this process, learners gain experience designing models that consider linguistic variables (text analysis, speech recognition, morpheme decomposition).",
    "When designing English/Korean classes using ChatGPT or AI tutors, learners create a checklist of ≥3 items to diagnose the comprehension level (beginner/intermediate/advanced) of teenage learners. They submit a four-session lesson plan applying three teaching strategies per level (e.g., visual aids, step-by-step grammar explanations, interactive activities). Additionally, they develop a five-criterion rubric (writing: grammar accuracy, vocabulary diversity; reading: text structure understanding, inference skills; expression: syntactic complexity, fluency) based on AI model outputs, achieving ≥80% suitability in peer reviews and instructor verification."
