  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Elementary language education theory (grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension), online learning platform management experience, basic reading/writing/speaking skills in digital environments, and understanding of digital communication patterns among adolescents",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A language education program for adolescents optimized for smartphone-based learning environments. It focuses on designing interactive structures using instant messaging (real-time feedback, collaborative learning, expressive diversity). Special attention is given to transforming adolescents' daily digital communication patterns into language learning (vocabulary expansion, grammatical accuracy, creative expression). Additionally, it includes diagnostic assessment tools for learners' text analysis and writing skills.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "By analyzing adolescents’ digital communication patterns (chatting, emoji use, abbreviations), learners can design ≥3 technology-based interaction models for language learning (vocabulary expansion, grammar practice, expressive creativity). Text-based analysis tools are used to evaluate reading comprehension and expressive diversity.",
    "Learners can establish and operate a real-time feedback system (grammar correction, vocabulary suggestions, expression diversification) using instant messaging tools in an LMS, designed to simultaneously enhance writing proficiency and speaking fluency.",
    "Learners can analyze ≥3 learner engagement structures (gamification, collaborative learning, personalized content) in tech-based language platforms (Duolingo, Quizlet) and evaluate tech-based language courses on a 5-point scale (1–5) based on criteria (engagement, interaction frequency, content utilization), using vocabulary acquisition and grammar accuracy as key metrics."
