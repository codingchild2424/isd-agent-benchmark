  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic English communication skills (daily conversation level) and foundational grammar structure knowledge (subject-verb agreement, tense usage, etc.), along with elementary digital device (tablet/laptop) operation proficiency",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",

    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A blended learning environment using digital devices (tablets/laptops). Requires small-group collaborative spaces for project-based learning. Provides vocabulary lists (50 words per topic) for language expression expansion and text analysis tools (lexical frequency analysis functionality). Establishes a learner-customized feedback system",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will enhance their sustained motivation for English learning by 80% or higher using gamification, goal-setting, and other motivational strategies, systematically recording vocabulary acquisition (30+ words per week) and reading progress (using text analysis tools) in learning journals.",
    "Learners will create a self-directed English learning plan three or more times per week for two weeks using digital tools (Anki, Quizlet, Google Docs, etc.), and prove execution through learning journals (including grammar error analysis and vocabulary usage examples) and quiz results (70%+ accuracy).",
    "During a 2–4 week mid-term course, learners will perform project-based assessments (role-play 1x, presentation 1x), apply strategies that incorporate peer feedback three or more times to maintain English learning motivation in real situations, and meet three or more of four peer evaluation checklist criteria (pronunciation, fluency, vocabulary diversity, grammatical accuracy)."
