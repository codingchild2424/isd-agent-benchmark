  "title": "Blended Learning Design and Language Education Competency Enhancement for Pre-Service Teachers: Scientific Approaches Focusing on Text, Vocabulary, and Communication",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic educational theory, general language teaching concepts (four language skills: reading/writing/listening/speaking), fundamental digital tool application, and understanding of scientific inquiry methods in language education",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Strengthens pre-service teachers' ICT utilization skills and critical instructional design capabilities through digital environment-based teaching design experiences. Focuses on cultivating the ability to design lessons integrating core elements of language education (grammar, vocabulary, text analysis, communication strategies). Emphasizes a scientific approach to demonstrating language education effectiveness through experimental, observational, and evidence collection/analysis processes.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will integrate grammar, vocabulary, and communication activities by applying ≥3 blended learning strategies (flipped learning, station rotation, project-based learning) and design evidence-based activities to improve learners’ language proficiency.",
    "Learners will plan and implement ≥2 mobile-based microlearning activities (word quizzes, short reading passages, pronunciation practice), observe and analyze learner responses, and derive improvement strategies.",
    "Through a 4-week project-based assessment, learners will develop one blended learning model applicable to actual classes, achieve ≥3.5 average on a peer assessment rubric (5 items: linguistic accuracy, creativity, technology use, practicality, evaluation system; 5-point scale), and submit analytical materials proving the model’s educational effectiveness."
