  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic digital tool proficiency and foundational educational theory understanding, along with elementary knowledge of social studies curricula (citizenship education, cultural comparison activities, etc.)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A teaching competency enhancement course for pre-service or in-service teachers. Participants collaboratively solve real-world social learning design problems from school settings (e.g., civic education, cultural comparison activity design) through shared case studies. Utilizes digital devices and professional development platforms (LMS), aiming to foster learners' citizenship and cultural understanding.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can select two neurocognitive principles (attention, working memory) in blended learning environments, design a social studies civics lesson plan (1 online + 1 offline) reflecting the principles, create a 10-slide PPT, and obtain a peer evaluation score of 4+ points (5-point scale).",
    "Learners can form a team of three peer teachers using collaborative learning (PLC), co-develop one set of digital learning materials (including ≥3 activities) for social studies cultural comparison within a week, and achieve an ‘excellent’ grade in at least four of five peer evaluation rubric items.",
    "Learners can analyze ≥3 sets of formative assessment data (quizzes, surveys, etc.) from graduate-level lectures within a week, propose ≥3 specific social studies learning design improvements (e.g., content restructuring, assessment method adjustments, feedback system enhancement), and explain the validity of the proposals with data-driven reasoning."
