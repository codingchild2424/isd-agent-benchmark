It focuses on case studies where digital technology contributes to solving social issues (e.g., improving accessibility, resource efficiency, and civic participation) and emphasizes connections to local community development.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners explain the operational principles of 8x3 encoder-decoder and Hamming code systems—core elements of digital communication—and create block diagrams applicable to social infrastructure (e.g., smart city networks, public data communication systems).",
    "Learners analyze three optimization techniques (e.g., power gating, clock gating, data path optimization) in reversible gate (RG)-based low-power encoder-decoder design within a week and present simulation results demonstrating over 20% power reduction in actual FPGA implementations for public applications (e.g., traffic control systems, energy management platforms).",
    "Learners perform digital module simulation and power consumption analysis using Xilinx/Cadence tools, verifying optimizations for social infrastructure (e.g., energy management systems, smart grids) and analyzing their impact on enhancing civic convenience.",
    "Learners select one industrial application case (e.g., voice recognition-based public services, machine translation for multicultural support) for a project-based assessment within a week, follow a 5-stage design process (requirements analysis → architecture design → module implementation → testing → documentation) to create an encoder-decoder system design document, and achieve an 'excellent' grade in at least two of four rubric criteria (clarity, completeness, practicality, social contribution)."
