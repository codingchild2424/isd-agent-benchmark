    "Learners can explain methods to evaluate training effectiveness using team tactical behavior analysis metrics (e.g., pass success rate, spatial utilization patterns, defensive transition efficiency).",
    "Learners can develop strategies to induce tactical exploratory behavior by manipulating game rules (e.g., adjusting attack/defense ratios, assigning differential scoring) based on youth athletes' age and skill levels."
