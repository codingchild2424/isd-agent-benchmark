  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Completion of advanced courses and substantial professional fieldwork experience. Possesses foundational social studies concepts (history, geography, cultural comparison) and the ability to recognize educational field challenges",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can apply at least three criteria to evaluate the credibility of diverse online information sources (e.g., historical context, source reliability, societal influence).",
    "Learners develop civic engagement strategies to address information gap issues in educational settings recreated in VR environments.",
    "Learners can complete a social studies-integrated information literacy lesson design plan (e.g., utilizing local history, comparative cultural analysis) through project-based assessment."
