  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can apply inquiry-based instructional principles (structured inquiry and guided inquiry) to elementary science lesson design.",
    "Learners can execute at least three on-the-fly scaffolding techniques (engagement prompting, focus prompting, problem-posing) to immediately address issues in students' inquiry processes.",
    "Learners can design inquiry lesson plans incorporating variable control strategies using elementary science concepts like thermal insulation."
