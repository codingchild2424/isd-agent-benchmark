    "Learners can accurately explain the visual-conceptual linkage structure of linguistic artifacts in a virtual museum environment with over 80% accuracy.",
    "The learning transfer effect can be analyzed with 75% accuracy by comparing interaction levels (high/low).",
    "The correlation between eye-tracking metrics (fixation duration, revisit count) and learning achievement can be presented in the project report."
