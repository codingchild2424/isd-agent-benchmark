    "Students use TA to represent biological classification systems (e.g., Animalia-Kingdom-Phylum-Class-Order-Family-Genus-Species) as concept maps, enhancing hierarchical reasoning skills.",
    "Learners analyze TA’s visual reasoning pathways to mimic scientific thinking processes and refine conceptual relationships based on error-correction feedback.",
    "By the end of instruction, over 80% of learners aim to achieve the benchmark score (70+ points) on the researcher-designed test (hierarchical classification problems)."
