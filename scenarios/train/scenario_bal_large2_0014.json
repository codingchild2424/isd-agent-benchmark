  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can identify the top 10 hazards at construction sites with 90% accuracy within three days and clearly explain related safety terminology.",
    "Through gamified simulations, learners select and verbally/textually describe appropriate response procedures within 10 seconds of encountering a hazardous situation.",
    "After training, learners upload at least three risk-identification case studies to a peer assessment system and provide feedback using specialized terminology."
