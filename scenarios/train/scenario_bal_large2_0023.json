  "title": "TPACK-Based Music Technology-Integrated Language Education Design: Text·Voice·Sound Integration Strategies for Enhanced Emotional Expression and Cognitive Learning",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic music theory, experience with digital tools, adaptability to VR/simulation environments, foundational music vocabulary (rhythm, melody, harmony, etc.), basic understanding of grammatical structures, creative text composition skills, fundamental communication abilities (reading, writing, listening, speaking), vocabulary expansion and sentence structure analysis basics, text analysis skills, and foundational writing techniques",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Simulation/VR-based",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Utilizing DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) and VR music production tools on personal BYOD devices. Designing collaborative projects to enhance emotion-based learning activities. Establishing feedback systems to improve linguistic expression in musical works (lyric creation, sound description). Applying multimodal assessment systems to simultaneously enhance learners' reading comprehension and expressive skills. Particularly developing rubrics comprehensively evaluating vocabulary selection, grammatical structures, text analysis, and vocal delivery methods. Includes creative writing and text interpretation tasks for integrated music-language assessment",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners apply the TPACK framework’s principles of integrating technology, pedagogy, and music content to effectively utilize linguistic expressions (rhythm, melody, lyric structure) in virtual music production projects. They creatively combine text-based narrative structures with vocal delivery methods while strengthening lyric-creation skills with accurate vocabulary and grammar. Reading comprehension-based text analysis and writing skills are integrated.",
    "Learners design one interactive music piece in Unity or Unreal Engine-based VR environments that evokes three emotional responses (tension, calmness, excitement). They achieve an average of 3.5 or higher on a 5-point scale from an expert panel (20% creativity, 30% technical completeness, 30% emotional impact, 20% linguistic appropriateness) and submit a portfolio proving the appropriateness of lyrics and sound effects through three case studies (dialogue-mood consistency, sound-situation linkage, cultural suitability). Additionally, learners analyze vocabulary selection and grammatical accuracy in the piece, identifying and correcting five or more errors in a report. Reading comprehension and writing skills are comprehensively assessed.",
    "Using BYOD-based collaboration tools, learners document the process of implementing musical ideas in large-scale team projects. They effectively perform linguistic communication (feedback, explanations, discussions) among team members while applying integrated listening, speaking, and writing strategies. Emphasis is placed on communication skills considering grammatical structures and vocabulary accuracy, with the goal of enhancing expressiveness through text analysis and vocal delivery."
