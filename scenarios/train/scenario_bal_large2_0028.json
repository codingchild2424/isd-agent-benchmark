  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can explain methodologies for efficiently searching academic library databases and electronic resources to extract information relevant to social science research topics (history, geography, economics, etc.). They particularly apply information search strategies considering cultural and political contexts and analyze relationships between various social systems.",
    "Learners apply techniques to evaluate and critically analyze academic information relevant to research topics, performing contextual interpretation considering historical and geographical factors. Through this, they derive evidence-based conclusions for civic rights and community development and develop policy proposals to address economic inequality.",
    "Using the ICE framework, learners collaboratively develop information utilization strategies with peers, establish interdisciplinary research collaboration systems and citizen-participatory research networks, seek practical solutions through political and economic system analysis, and explore inclusive policy designs reflecting cultural diversity."
