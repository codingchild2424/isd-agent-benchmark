    "In team-based emergency situations, learners reduce decision-making time by 30% and clarify role distribution.",
    "During a two-week CPR training course, learners self-assess their responsibility (5-point scale) and emotional regulation (5-point scale) weekly. In a final three-page report, they analyze how personality traits affected CPR performance using three specific examples (e.g., maintaining compression depth, team communication)."
