    "Learners complete computer language tasks based on behavior analysis principles with 80% accuracy, analyzing text structures and vocabulary usage patterns.",
    "In the language domain, learners use a computer-based feedback system to perform self-corrections in at least three out of four attempts, improving grammatical errors and expression methods.",
    "Learners analyze formative assessment data to reduce individual learning gaps by 50% within two weeks, enhancing reading comprehension and writing skills."
