  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can apply the 4C/ID model’s four components (learning objectives, learning tasks, supportive information, procedural information) to patient diagnosis protocols and nursing intervention designs.",
    "Learners can comparatively analyze structural differences in domestic and international clinical practicum curricula from a 4C/ID model perspective and evaluate differences in symptom management and treatment protocols.",
    "Learners can implement project-based assessments to enhance practical skills in mobile microlearning environments and verify compliance with patient safety and medical protocols."
