  "title": "[Large-Scale] Case-Based Language Analysis and Communication Project Learning for Strengthening Safety Decision-Making Competencies",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic safety management concepts, industrial field experience, understanding of technical terminology and report-writing skills, foundational grammar comprehension, text analysis experience, and ability to adapt between language styles (formal/informal, written/oral)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Practice-focused education for managers/leaders in mobile learning environments using smartphones. Supports text analysis and report writing activities. Learners strengthen communication competencies by practicing situational language style adaptation (formal/informal, written/spoken). Focuses on discourse analysis, technical terminology, and integrating nonverbal expressions.",

    "learner_age": "40s and above",
    "learner_education": "Adult learner (non-degree)",
    "learner_role": "Office worker (administrative/management)",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Development of language analysis skills to identify risk factors with ≥80% accuracy by analyzing text data from real industrial accident cases (utilizing vocabulary extraction, contextual analysis, text mining, and discourse analysis).",
    "Learners must select two frameworks (HAZID, FMEA, SWIFT) and systematically organize a 5-stage response plan (risk identification → impact analysis → response strategy development → implementation plan → monitoring) for chemical leaks or fire emergencies. They must verbally explain the plan within 30 minutes using ≥10 specialized terms (e.g., LD50, LEL, UEL, NFPA rating, PPE, ERG, HAZWOPER, ICS, IAP, JHA) with ≥80% accuracy. Evaluation follows a rubric: structured expression (30%), specialized terminology (40%), situational language strategy (30%).",
    "In team-based projects (4-person groups), learners must derive three language communication improvement strategies for a given business scenario, prepare a 5-page report and 10-minute presentation, and propose solutions meeting ≥2 of the three feasibility criteria (validity, effectiveness, practicality). (Assesses report writing, presentation skills, communication strategy, and discourse organization).",
    "In post-assessment, ≥90% of participants must confirm improvements in safety decision-making processes through verbal/nonverbal expressions (facial expressions, gestures, vocal tone, nonverbal cues). (Measures communication effectiveness and feedback analysis)."
