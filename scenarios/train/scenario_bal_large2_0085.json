  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational physics theories, basic pedagogical knowledge, proficiency in basic mathematical formulas (equations, functions, differential equations) and graph interpretation, and understanding of probability/statistics basics (regression analysis, correlation, statistical significance)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Fostering reflective thinking via e-portfolios in a smartphone-centric limited-technology environment, tailored for in-service corporate professionals. Includes activities modeling physical phenomena with mathematical models (differential equations, simulations). Emphasizes data-driven decision-making and graph interpretation skills, developing mathematical thinking through experimental data collection/analysis, model validation, and result visualization",

    "learner_role": "Professional (medical/legal/technical)",
    "domain_expertise": "Beginner"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Across 3 stages (instructional design, lesson demonstration, video production), learners will solve physics problems via reflective thinking and mathematical modeling (equations, functions, differential equations) using graph/simulation-based approaches.",
    "Learners will analyze 3 dimensions (focus, inquiry, change) and 4 levels (routine, technical, dialogic, transformative) of reflective thinking using mathematical formulas (regression, function modeling, statistical significance tests) and visualization tools (graphs, charts, simulations).",
    "Learners practice dialogic-level reflective thinking through peer feedback and probabilistic analysis (statistical significance testing, correlation analysis) and interpret educational data using statistical methods (mean, standard deviation, variance analysis)."
