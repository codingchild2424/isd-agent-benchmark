  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners independently design language learning content (text, audio, vocabulary materials) using various mobile media tools (recording/editing apps, SNS-based collaboration platforms).",
    "Learners complete formative assessments (quizzes, voice feedback) provided in mobile environments with over 80% accuracy and analyze grammatical structures and expression methods.",
    "Learners independently resolve over 90% of technical issues (storage management, compatibility issues) encountered while using mobile media and apply solutions to diverse language learning scenarios."
