    "Learners will apply self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies with over 80% accuracy to derive text-based solutions in real-world COVID-19 problem scenarios",
    "Learners will present at least three decision-making criteria demonstrating critical thinking in a multimedia game-based simulation environment using linguistic expressions (vocabulary/grammar)",
    "Learners will use self-assessment rubrics to review their learning process, reflect on feedback in over 70% of items in reflective reports, and construct logical expression structures"
