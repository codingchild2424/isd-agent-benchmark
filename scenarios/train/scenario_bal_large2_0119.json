    "Learners select 3 enterprise practical problems (inventory optimization, budget allocation, production planning), apply activity-based learning techniques (2 case studies, 1 simulation), and collaborate with 3–4 team members to design a problem-solving process (problem definition → data collection → modeling → verification → report writing). Within 4 weeks, they submit a 10-page final report (APA format) and 15-minute presentation (10–12 slides), achieving an average of 3+ points (out of 4) in the report evaluation rubric (clarity, analytical depth, practicality, collaboration effectiveness).",
