  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic nursing theory and clinical practice experience, foundational understanding of scientific methodology (systematic observation, hypothesis formulation, control of independent/dependent variables, experiment design), basic knowledge of medical protocols and evidence-based practice (EBP), and fundamental statistical analysis skills",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "In blended asynchronous/synchronous learning environments using mobile devices and LMS, learners systematically analyze patient symptom data and experience deriving clinical conclusions. The program integrates medical protocols with scientific inquiry processes (hypothesis verification, data analysis, conclusion drawing) through content incorporating real clinical cases, experimental design, and evidence collection. Particularly emphasizes case studies applying scientific methodologies such as control group setup, data cross-verification, and correlation analysis.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can apply scientific inquiry methods (hypothesis formulation, control of independent/dependent variables, quantitative evidence collection) to 8 nursing core competency topics (medication management, patient assessment, emergency care) in a blended learning environment, achieving ≥80% accuracy.",
    "Learners can perform self-directed learning ≥2 times per week via mobile microlearning modules, systematically observe, precisely measure, and statistically analyze clinical data, documenting findings in a learning journal. Specifically, they analyze correlations between patient symptom patterns and treatment efficacy using scientific methodologies (correlation analysis, regression analysis).",
    "Learners can participate in weekly online discussions (2 sessions) and virtual simulations (4 sessions) over 1–6 months, complete 3 peer evaluations and 2 self-evaluations, write a report meeting ≥4 out of 5 critical thinking rubric criteria, and achieve ≥80% accuracy on a 10-item clinical judgment scenario test. Additionally, they apply experimental design principles (randomized controlled group setup, data cross-validation) to analyze ≥2 cases and justify clinical decisions using evidence-based practice."
