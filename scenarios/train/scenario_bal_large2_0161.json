    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Collaboration between science instructional designers and professors to develop effective experiment/observation-centered curricula. Conducts offline lab classes in BYOD environments, progressing toward summative assessments (lab reports, data analysis results).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will explain the four core stages of the Collaborative Mapping Model (CMM: Observation–Hypothesis–Experiment–Analysis) and apply them to science curriculum design case studies.",
    "Learners will propose at least three strategies for building trust-based relationships between instructional designers and instructors, such as collaborative hypothesis development, variable control collaboration, and evidence-based feedback.",
    "When designing science curricula, learners will suggest methods to strengthen instructor-student interactions (e.g., collaborative experiment design, data analysis discussions) using the CMM."
