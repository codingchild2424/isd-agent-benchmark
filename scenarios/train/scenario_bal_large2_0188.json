  "learning_goals": [
    "Students design one science experiment model using smartphone-based makerspace tools (Tinkercad, Fusion 360), implement it via 3D printing or virtual simulation, and achieve ≥4 points (out of 5) in each of three peer evaluation rubric items (functionality, creativity, accuracy).",
    "During a one-week intensive course, learners select three scientific concepts (thermodynamics laws, molecular structure, experimental error analysis) in English, write a 150-word report or 1-minute 40-second presentation per concept, and meet peer evaluation standards (clarity ≥70%, grammar accuracy ≥80%) and instructor feedback (rubric score ≥8/10).",
    "Students enhance scientific inquiry processes and creative design skills through team-based problem-solving activities."
