  "title": "[Large-Scale] Advanced Course on Mathematical Terminology Pedagogy Through Integration of Second Language Acquisition Theory: Strengthening Mathematical Concept Systems and Cultivating Proof Skills",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic mathematical terminology, elementary education experience, basic computational skills and formula interpretation, comprehension of simple proof structures, and foundational graph interpretation and data analysis skills",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course for in-service elementary teachers to strengthen mathematical terminology instruction competencies. A job training program administered by corporate education departments, emphasizing cultivation of proof-based and applied mathematical concept abilities. Learning activities highlight graph utilization and statistical analysis for real-life problem-solving (evidence-based teaching method application and experimental design competency development).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Establishing a math terminology analysis system combining generative grammar theory and usage-based theory to enhance structural understanding of mathematical concepts: strengthening formula derivation and graph interpretation skills (cultivating concept generalization through variable-controlled experiments).",
    "Learners solve at least three real business problems by integrating probabilistic-statistical approaches (frequency interpretation) and equation modeling (linear/nonlinear regression) through frequency-based activity designs (e.g., customer data analysis scenarios). They submit reports applying mathematical concepts with over 80% accuracy per problem, including data measurement, analysis, and visualization.",
    "Learners systematically learn 20 high-grammatical-difficulty math terms (e.g., fractions, geometry terms) within six months and develop instructional materials enabling 80%+ accuracy in formula application and graph interpretation problems per term. The materials include three difficulty levels (basic-applied-advanced), evaluation checklists, proof problems, and a hypothesis-experiment-conclusion structure per level.",
    "Learners propose within two weeks assessment metrics for three types of math problems (calculation, graph, proof) occurring in real corporate environments (e.g., financial analysis, data visualization, process verification). Metrics include calculation accuracy (≥90%), graph analysis (meeting 3-tier criteria), and proof completeness (≥4/5 on a rubric), applying the scientific inquiry process."
