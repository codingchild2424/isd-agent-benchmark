  "title": "Designing High School Biology Pedagogy with Digital Technology: Language-Integrated Inquiry Approach (Enhancing Scientific Text Analysis and Technical Terminology Usage)",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "High school-level life science knowledge, digital tool usage experience, scientific terminology comprehension, technical writing skills, and basic grammar/vocabulary for inquiry report writing, foundational scientific text analysis capabilities",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course strengthening competencies in designing and implementing digital technology-integrated lessons in biology education. Includes simulation projects reflecting real school environments. Emphasizes language-integrated activities such as science text analysis, lab report writing, and digital content explanations, focusing on comprehensive improvement of reading comprehension, expression, and grammar usage. Rubrics evaluating specialized terminology and logical text organization are applied, with peer review and expert validation measuring language integration competencies from multiple perspectives.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Using digital simulation tools (virtual labs, 3D modeling), learners accurately explain molecular genetics concepts with ≥3 scientific terms, systematically analyze experimental observations, and demonstrate clarity in the inquiry process (hypothesis setting-variable control-conclusion drawing) with precise terminology.",
    "Learners design a 5-point rubric using Google Forms/Microsoft Forms to measure PBL outcomes (task completeness, creativity, collaboration). The rubric must receive ≥3-point validity ratings from ≥2 out of 3 peer evaluators and meet clarity (≥80%) and feedback expression (≥70%) criteria in the report (including grammar and terminology evaluation).",
    "In a BYOD environment, trainees use Google Docs/Sheets and Padlet to design 3 PBL lesson plans (evaluated on learning objective clarity and explanatory coherence), achieve ≥80% learner engagement, and develop an operational plan scoring ≥4/5 on peer rubrics. Each project is developed in 2-week cycles, and final outputs must pass expert panel validation (including text structure and vocabulary appropriateness).",
    "Learners identify ≥5 biology digital contents (AR/VR materials), repurpose them for educational goals, and write logical, terminology-rich descriptions (evaluated on text structure, vocabulary appropriateness, and integrated reading/writing skills)."
