Systematically collecting and analyzing observational records and experimental data to validate instructional design validity is central.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Based on the five TPSR model elements (task leadership, individual leadership, social leadership, teamwork leadership, leadership transfer), learners will design and submit a student-centered responsibility education program within the 6-month course that applies scientific inquiry methods (variable control, systematic data collection, hypothesis testing) to control three key variables (participation, behavioral change, satisfaction). The submission must achieve a score of 4 or higher (on a 5-point scale) in four out of five rubric criteria (e.g., clarity of variable control, systematicity of data collection, validity of hypothesis testing, program feasibility, TPSR element application).",
    "Learners will accurately execute collaborative problem-solving strategies in SEM model-applied team sports activities at an 80% success rate or higher and scientifically analyze changes in team dynamics through experimental observation and quantitative analysis.",
    "Using a sportsmanship assessment rubric, learners will evaluate the character development level of participants in three or more distinct stages and provide feedback supported by data-driven evidence."
