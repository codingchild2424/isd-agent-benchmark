  "title": "[Large-Scale] Reflective Practice Strategies for Digital Education in the Pandemic Era: Strengthening Social Context and Civic Competencies",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic proficiency in digital education platforms, elementary education field experience, foundational understanding of social interaction and community development, basic concepts of citizen rights and responsibilities, comprehension of education policy within historical/geographical contexts",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Content design optimized for smartphone-based learning environments is necessary. Emphasizing practical, job-centered training for current elementary school teachers, the design highlights inclusive education that considers learners' cultural backgrounds and economic conditions. Institutional support mechanisms must be explored to ensure digital accessibility for vulnerable learners. Educational design should account for regional economic/political structures and cultural diversity, while establishing assessment systems to strengthen civic competencies.",

    "learner_age": "In their 30s",
    "learner_education": "Adult learner (non-degree)",
    "learner_role": "Office worker (administrative/management)",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will analyze digital education cases from the pandemic period to derive three instructional strategy improvements addressing changes in social relationships and civic engagement patterns, emphasizing strategies that consider local institutional and cultural diversity factors.",
    "Learners will design problem-solving processes in educational settings using the reflection-in-action technique, strengthening digital literacy and cultural diversity understanding as citizens, thereby enhancing awareness of learners' rights and responsibilities.",
    "Over 12 weeks, learners will plan one online learning module consisting of up to five modules reflecting welding skills education and community needs (e.g., local industrial complex workforce demands) in a limited internet environment (≤5 Mbps). The module must meet the following: (1) achieve ≥80% learner engagement (based on attendance and activity logs), (2) score ≥4 points (out of 5) on content accessibility surveys, and (3) include ≥3 inclusive strategies for economic disparity reduction (e.g., low-spec device compatibility, offline materials). All criteria will be validated via institutional rubrics, with module design reflecting local economic structures and socio-political contexts."
