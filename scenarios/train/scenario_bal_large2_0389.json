    "Learners can demonstrate language expression skills by applying Merrill’s instructional interaction stages (present real-world problems, analyze requirements, explain core principles, guide performance, provide feedback) in VR environments.",
    "Learners understand XML-based tagging systems and can modularly organize language content for VR scenarios.",
    "Learners perform team project-based assessments (3-person groups, 3 hours) in BYOD (personal device) environments, create and present role-play scenarios utilizing ≥3 communication strategies (e.g., active listening, clear questioning, cultural consideration) applicable to real workplace situations (meetings, negotiations, customer consultations)."
