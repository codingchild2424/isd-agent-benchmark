  "title": "[Large-scale] Immersive Language Education Design Using 360° VR: Integrated Approach to Text, Expression, and Reading Comprehension for Real-Life Communication Skills",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic digital device operation skills, foreign language learning experience, foundational grammar understanding and situational expression acquisition, text-based learning experience (reading/writing), and introductory knowledge of VR environments",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "In a smartphone-centric limited-technology environment, there is a need to build language learning environments utilizing 360° VR content, with a focus on designing materials that simultaneously enhance reading comprehension and expressive skills. Learners experience real-life scenarios reflecting diverse cultural backgrounds to understand the social context of the target language. Text-based interactions within the VR environment (reading subtitles, selecting dialogues) reinforce the context of language acquisition, cultivating situational vocabulary usage and grammar application skills.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "In a 360° VR environment, learners immerse themselves in real-life conversational scenarios (e.g., travel, shopping, business meetings) in the target language, improving listening/speaking communication skills and situational vocabulary/grammar application. Through text-based interactions in VR (dialogue selection, reading situational descriptions), they strengthen reading comprehension and contextual understanding.",
    "Learners use VR content editing tools (Adobe Premiere Pro VR or Wonda VR) to divide one 360° language-learning video by theme (e.g., travel) into three sections (greetings, ordering, negotiation). They add accurate subtitles (90%+ accuracy) and grammar explanations (3+ sentences) for each section, then submit a final product within three weeks that meets four or more of the five evaluation criteria (subtitle accuracy, grammatical appropriateness, situational relevance, creativity, technical completion). Notably, they maintain textual consistency while analyzing vocabulary, expressions, and sentence structures of the target language during subtitle creation.",
    "Learners share and provide feedback on 360° language-learning content with peers via collaboration platforms (Google Workspace, Padlet, etc.), enhancing peer evaluation skills and critical thinking. Feedback evaluates accurate expressions, cultural context, textual consistency, vocabulary appropriateness, and grammatical accuracy in the target language."
