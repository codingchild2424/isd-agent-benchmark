    "Applying the ADDIE model (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation), learners select three core modules from an existing nurse orientation program, reconstruct learning objectives, content, methods, and assessment tools for each module, and submit a 5-page plan within one week.",
    "Ensure alignment (80%+ achievement) between learning objectives, assessments, and activities through competency-based curriculum development",
    "Design efficient knowledge delivery methods for large learner groups (30+) in mobile microlearning environments",
    "Within one week, learners address a workforce reduction scenario in medical/nursing organizations by (1) completing a 5-item needs analysis checklist, (2) deriving strategies to maintain 80% of core tasks during role redesign, and (3) drafting a 20% budget reduction execution plan. They achieve at least 7/10 points on the evaluation rubric."
