    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A blended e-learning environment for digital literacy education integrated with science curricula. Learners engage in project-based learning by combining scientific inquiry methods (observation, hypothesis formation, experimental design) with digital tools. Digital devices are institutionally provided, with emphasis on scientific analysis and evidence collection during the learning process.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can critically evaluate science-related online information sources, select experimental data and evidence-based materials, and apply them to digital content creation",
    "Learners can design interactive science education games using web-based tools and implement game mechanics reflecting variable control and hypothesis verification",
    "Learners can operate peer feedback systems using digital collaboration tools (e.g., Google Workspace) during project execution and share scientific analysis results"
