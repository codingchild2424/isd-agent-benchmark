  "title": "[Large-Scale] Workplace-Centered Language Competency Enhancement Program for Professionals Using Blended Learning: Text Structuring, Lexical Diversity, Communication Accuracy, and Cultural Adaptability Improvement",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic language proficiency (able to engage in daily conversation and write simple documents), experience using online learning tools, understanding of basic business terminology, fundamental text structuring skills, experience using context-appropriate vocabulary for tasks, and foundational awareness of multicultural environments",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Project-based blended learning for workplace language proficiency enhancement in digital device-supported environments. Tasks mirror real-world professional contexts (global communication, report writing, video conferences) to strengthen job applicability. Focuses on logical structuring of business texts, specialized vocabulary usage, intercultural communication competence, and culturally contextualized language strategies.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners prove intermediate-level language proficiency (grammar accuracy, lexical diversity, text structuring) in work-related topics (meetings, report writing, email writing) by achieving ≥80% mastery in ≥4 of 5 rubric criteria (pronunciation, fluency, vocabulary, grammar, task appropriateness) across 3 simulated work scenarios within one week. Emphasis is placed on logical structuring of business texts, specialized vocabulary usage, and cross-cultural communication strategies.",
    "Learners integrate digital learning platforms (Google Classroom, Moodle, etc.) with face-to-face classes, set 3 weekly learning objectives (integrated listening–speaking–writing goals), and execute self-directed learning plans by achieving ≥80% of weekly checklists. This process strengthens business-appropriate writing and expression skills while developing vocabulary expansion strategies for global communication contexts.",
    "In 3-member team projects, learners complete 2 language tasks reflecting real-world work environments (e.g., global corporate email writing, video conference interpretation) and achieve ≥70/100 on evaluation rubrics (communication accuracy 40%, task appropriateness 30%, collaboration efficiency 30%), demonstrating applied language skills. Through team-based activities, learners develop context-appropriate linguistic expressions, collaboration strategies, and culturally sensitive communication techniques."
