  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Fundamental STEM knowledge, presentation experience, basic communication skills considering diverse audiences (class, culture, region), understanding of civic participation processes for community problem-solving, and basic awareness of social rights and systems",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Vocational training institution curriculum conducting project-based assessments in smartphone-centric limited-technology environments. Learners present STEM solutions reflecting local historical/geographical characteristics, honing civic communication skills and community development competencies. Aims for local economic revitalization and social relationship improvement while promoting cultural/political context understanding.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners apply the GPS model (General → Specific → Concrete) to design logical structures for 10-minute oral presentations on STEM topics (e.g., renewable energy technology). They connect ≥70% of content to local historical/geographical cases (e.g., industrial heritage, topographical features), achieve ≥4 points average (5-point scale) in peer evaluation rubrics (clarity of structure, local relevance, delivery effectiveness), and propose civic engagement strategies for community development",
    "Learners produce 3-minute explanatory videos that simplify technical documents (e.g., IT system manuals, engineering reports) for non-experts (executives, customers, community members). They receive ≥4 points (5-point scale) in \"clarity\" and \"accessibility\" from ≥4 out of 5 peer evaluators. They apply communication strategies considering cultural/class differences and institutional characteristics of the local community, using expressions that improve social relationships",
    "Learners revise presentation materials ≥3 times based on peer feedback and instructor evaluations, strengthening social communication competencies that reflect stakeholder needs (citizens, policymakers, corporate representatives). They also cultivate the ability to design curricula reflecting community development goals"
