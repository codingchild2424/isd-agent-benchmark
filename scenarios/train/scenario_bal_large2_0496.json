    "Within five days (40 hours), learners can develop a prototype HTML/CSS/JS-based digital assessment system that converts and visualizes (graphs/tables) GCS scores (eye, verbal, motor responses) on 4-6 point scales using linear regression and fuzzy logic techniques, meeting the following criteria: 1) implementation of three-item input functionality, 2) 90%+ conversion accuracy, 3) responsive web design",
    "In teams of 3-4, learners can analyze two user interface optimization problems from real development projects, design solutions using instructional design approaches (one user test, three WCAG 2.1 accessibility improvements), and submit 10-15 minute presentation materials (PPT/PDF) achieving 'excellent' ratings in at least four of five rubric criteria"
