    "Learners can apply core concepts of chaos and complex systems theory (sensitivity to initial conditions, self-organization, etc.) to the design of remote science education.",
    "Learners can plan flexible instructional designs reflecting scientific inquiry processes in unpredictable learning environments.",
    "Learners can develop three interaction strategies for small learner groups: sharing experimental observations, hypothesis verification discussions, and collaborative data analysis.",
    "Learners can complete science inquiry projects utilizing smartphone-based assessment tools (sensor measurements, image analysis, etc.)."
