    "Participants analyze problem situations arising from digital technology integration in educational settings and propose solutions using a hermeneutic phenomenological approach.",
    "In a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) environment, design one VR/simulation-based math learning module using Unity or Unreal Engine, operate it for 10 learners over two weeks, and develop a formative assessment system (5-question quiz + observation checklist) achieving ≥80% learning outcomes."
