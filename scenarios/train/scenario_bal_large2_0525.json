  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic chemistry concepts, general understanding of sustainability, ability to interpret basic statistics (mean/variance) and graphs (bar/line), foundational equation-solving skills",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Targeting pre-service teachers in medical/legal/technical fields, this blended learning environment using digital devices (tablets/laptops) emphasizes math-based problem-solving activities with data analysis tools (Excel, R, etc.). It includes applied examples of computational skills (matrix operations/optimization) and probabilistic reasoning (conditional probability/Bayes’ theorem).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners explain the scientific principles of flame-retardant bamboo as a sustainable material and apply chemical concepts to engineering problems by converting them into mathematical models (equations/formulas).",
    "Learners analyze instructional design phases using an exploratory sequential mixed-methods approach and restructure them with statistical methods (regression analysis/hypothesis testing).",
    "Learners develop learning stages for the flame-retardant bamboo theme according to the Model for Educational Reconstruction (MER) and validate the model using probabilistic verification methods (Monte Carlo simulation/confidence interval analysis).",
    "Learners measure self-efficacy achievement of over 85% and improvements in sustainability awareness, visualize these using graphs (histograms/scatter plots), and perform correlation analysis."
