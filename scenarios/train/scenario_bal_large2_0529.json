  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Intermediate-level basic science knowledge (experimental design, data analysis), experience with online learning tools, and foundational understanding of scientific inquiry methods",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learners are current science practitioners aiming to enhance problem-solving competencies through collaborative reflection with peers based on work experience. Digital devices (laptops/tablets) are provided, and online collaboration platforms and blog tools are utilized for project execution. The learning process emphasizes improving experimental observation recording, evidence-based conclusion drawing, and scientific communication skills.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners engage in blog-based reflective writing at least twice weekly to solve practical problems in science, systematically documenting experimental data and hypothesis verification processes.",
    "Learners provide constructive feedback from the perspectives of variable control and scientific analysis on peers’ blog posts at least once, deepening their understanding of the learning content.",
    "Learners apply the ICE model (Idea-Connection-Expansion) to structure their cognitive development and professional growth during the scientific inquiry process."
