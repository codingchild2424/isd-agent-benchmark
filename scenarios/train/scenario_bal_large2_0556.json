    "Learners can analyze functional requirements of EPSS components (tutorials, examples, resources, tools, wizards) and design optimizations tailored to language learning content (text, vocabulary, grammar).",
    "Learners can develop and implement an EPSS prototype specialized for language education activities (integrated reading, writing, listening, speaking) to enhance the work efficiency of novice instructional designers (NIDs).",
    "Learners can establish an EPSS evaluation system specialized for language education domains (grammatical accuracy, lexical diversity, expressive fluency) and derive improvement plans through formative assessments."
