  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Advanced science domain expertise (experimental design/data analysis experience), basic digital literacy, foundational understanding of scientific inquiry adaptations for learning-disabled students, mastery of variable control and evidence-based analysis methods, scientific hypothesis formulation and experimental protocol design skills",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Customized online educational environment for professionals, emphasizing activity-based teaching methods evaluation and design with accessibility considerations for learners with disabilities. The curriculum focuses on developing educational materials that highlight core scientific processes such as experimentation, observation, variable control, data analysis, and evidence-based conclusions. It particularly incorporates systematic observation recording methods and strategies for deriving evidence-based conclusions to enhance scientific inquiry skills.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Identify three or more activity-based lesson types (experimental design, systematic observation recording, hypothesis verification, and variable control) suitable for students with learning disabilities and explain how to apply the scientific inquiry process (measurement/analysis/evidence collection/conclusion).",
    "Learners implement a hybrid class design within a 6-month course, including small-group collaboration (weekly science discussions ×2), individual assignments (three experimental reports by topic), PPT presentations (10-minute analysis of results and evidence-based conclusions ×2), formative assessments (four science concept quizzes), and achieve 80% or higher satisfaction in peer evaluations and instructor feedback.",
    "Develop a three-tier evaluation system (basic, advanced, comprehensive) to assess how teaching method diversity and frequency impact learning outcomes (experimental skill acquisition, data analysis ability, scientific thinking, evidence-based conclusion skills)."
