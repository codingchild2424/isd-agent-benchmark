    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Design at least three strategies to apply the three elements of self-determination theory (autonomy, competence, relatedness) to an online Chinese learning environment",
    "Learners can design two motivation-boosting activities applying two or more gamification elements (point system, leaderboard, badge awards) to engage students in a vocational training institution, and submit a prototype reflecting peer evaluation (average 3.5+ on a 5-point scale) and instructor feedback (80%+ feasibility) by the end of a three-week course.",
    "Learners can perform three or more peer feedback sessions per team project using Google Docs comments or Mentimeter real-time polls in a blended learning environment (online forum + face-to-face workshop) over two weeks and achieve \"excellent\" grades in two or more of three feedback quality criteria (clarity, constructiveness, timeliness).",
    "Learners can conduct project-based assessments (one team project) during a four-week mid-term course, maintain a personal motivation portfolio (weekly goal setting, performance records, reflective journaling), and achieve \"excellent\" grades in four or more of five evaluation rubric items (goal clarity, performance measurement, reflection depth, creativity, delivery) in the final presentation."
