  "title": "Large-Scale Interdisciplinary Design Thinking Integration Course for Language Instructional Design Expertise Development: Enhancing Text, Expression, and Reading Comprehension Skills",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Introductory instructional design concepts, foundational language education knowledge (grammar, vocabulary, text analysis), digital tool utilization experience, and basic writing/reading comprehension skills",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Designed for working professionals with beginner-level language expertise, focusing on real-time collaborative learning (video conferencing/cloud-based document sharing) in digitally supported environments. Aims to improve writing/reading skills, particularly enhancing communication competencies in multicultural settings.",
    "institution_type": "Corporate/Enterprise",
    "learner_age": "In their 20s",
    "learner_education": "Adult learner (non-degree)",
    "learner_role": "Office worker (administrative/management)",
    "domain_expertise": "Beginner"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "By analyzing thinking patterns across various design fields, students can derive three creative methodologies (e.g., visual literacy enhancement strategies, vocabulary network mapping, multimodal text analysis techniques) applicable to language instructional design processes.",
    "Through an interdisciplinary approach, students will develop and practice two crossover strategies (e.g., integrated expression-reading strategies using digital media, augmented reality-based grammar contextualization strategies) for language education design.",
    "Referencing three comprehensive literature analyses on language learning theories and instructional design models (e.g., sociocultural language acquisition theory, multimedia learning frameworks), learners will identify two key limitations of existing models—lack of cultural context reflection and insufficient digital environment adaptability—and submit a team-based draft of a creative design framework (including a structure diagram and three core strategies: cultural content integration, interactive assessment tools, personalized vocabulary recommendation systems) within one week."
