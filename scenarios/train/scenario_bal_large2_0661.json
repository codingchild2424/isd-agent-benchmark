    "Learners can build 2 mathematical models using real workplace data (e.g., production line efficiency, inventory management data), systematically analyze results following a 4-stage process (problem definition, modeling, verification, solution proposal), present findings, and achieve at least 3 points (out of 5) on an evaluation rubric (model appropriateness, data usability, logical consistency).",
    "In 3-person project teams, learners can perform data collection (from at least 2 sources), processing (using Excel/statistical tools), and interpretation (visualization and trend analysis) with a given dataset, reflect the experiential learning cycle (experience-reflection-conceptualization-application) in 1-page reports per stage, and submit final project deliverables.",
    "Learners submit three individual portfolios documenting their mathematical thinking processes and problem-solving strategies during the mid-term course (4 weeks) and achieve scores meeting at least four out of five self-assessment checklist items and three out of four peer-assessment rubric items."
