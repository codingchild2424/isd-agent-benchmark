  "title": "[Large-scale] Medical Communication Collaborative Learning Program for Preventing Surgical Site Infections: Specialized Terminology and Protocol-Integrated Language Learning",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic operating room infection control procedures, job experience, comprehension of medical terminology, ability to draft basic medical documents, foundational medical communication skills (speaking, listening, reading, writing)",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "An online collaborative learning program for medical company practitioners to enhance surgical infection prevention capabilities. It focuses on improving medical communication skills (speaking, listening, reading, writing) and evaluates proficiency in professional terminology and protocol adherence. It comprehensively assesses medical text analysis, specialized vocabulary usage, clear expression, and effective reading comprehension.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can apply evidence-based protocols for preventing surgical site infections with over 80% accuracy and develop language skills to clearly express related medical terminology and procedures.",
    "Learners can demonstrate collaborative language skills meeting four or more of the five evaluation criteria (clarity of communication, role clarity, protocol adherence, use of professional terminology, emergency response) by performing role-playing three or more times with a multidisciplinary team (nurses, doctors, technicians, etc.) in infection control scenarios (e.g., operating room infection prevention, isolation ward protocols).",
    "Learners can establish infection prevention action plans based on peer feedback through LMS assignments and peer reviews and improve report-writing skills (grammar, vocabulary, text structure) according to medical documentation standards.",
    "Using video cases and virtual simulations, learners can identify three or more infection risk factors in operating room environments, explain them using professional terminology, and strengthen their ability to read medical texts."
