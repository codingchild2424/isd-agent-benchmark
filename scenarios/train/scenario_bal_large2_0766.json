  "title": "[Large-Scale] Creativity Development Based on Traditional Music: Exploring Guqin Rhythm Patterns Through Mathematical Analysis (Utilizing Fractions, Decimals, and Graphs)",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic traditional instrument performance, understanding of music theory, mastery of foundational math concepts (fractions, decimals, ratios), and graph representation skills",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Simulation/VR-based",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Creativity development program using the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Guqin instrument. Short workshop format for enhancing current professionals' work extensibility, cultivating data-based analysis abilities and equation/statistics application skills through music-mathematics integration.",
    "institution_type": "Public/Non-profit educational institution",
    "learner_age": "In their 30s",
    "learner_education": "University",
    "learner_role": "Student",
    "domain_expertise": "Beginner"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Over 80% of learners can explain the cultural significance of Guqin and its performance techniques (including mathematical elements like rhythmic division and beat calculation) alongside fractional/decimal-based pitch ratio calculations.",
    "All participants create ≥1 traditional scale variation composition using VR simulation, applying fractional/decimal-based pitch ratio calculations and graphical representations.",
    "Learners analyze ≥3 rhythm patterns extracted from traditional music (e.g., Samulnori, Pansori) using mathematical methods (fractions, decimals, ratios, graphical representations), write a 5-page report, and achieve ≥4 points (out of 5) in ≥2 of three evaluation criteria (content accuracy, analytical depth, creativity)."
