    "Learners can apply a community-based production process (co-design, feedback loops, role distribution) to research, select one local community issue with 5–10 adolescents, establish collaborative problem-solving strategies (action plan, role distribution chart, evaluation criteria) over 8 weeks, and submit a prototype outcome.",
