  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic digital tool proficiency, foundational understanding of language learning (grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, expression), collaborative communication experience, and elementary analytical skills for diverse text types (explanatory, argumentative, etc.)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Activity-driven course focusing on immediately applicable collaborative learning strategies and language modeling techniques. Develops argument structuring, multimodal text interpretation (integrated reading/listening), and context-specific expression strategies (integrated speaking/writing). Incorporates MoCAS-based real-time feedback and assessment systems.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can design and execute team-based argumentation activities using the Collaborative Instructional Framework (CIF), develop logical expression and critical-thinking-based communication skills, and strengthen argument structuring competencies through integrated complex text analysis (reading-listening).",
    "Learners can use the MoCAS tool to achieve over 80% participation rates (based on attendance and activity logs) in online/offline environments for project planning, conflict resolution, and idea-sharing scenarios over two weeks, and perform effective communication (integrated speaking, writing, listening) scoring 3 or higher on each of the four-point evaluation criteria (clarity, logic, collaboration, expression) for a total of 12 or more points.",
    "Learners can apply an educational language model based on Bloom’s Taxonomy analysis level to practical tasks, enhance text analysis, organization, and evaluation competencies, and develop expression strategies for various genres (explanatory texts, argumentative texts, creative writing)."
