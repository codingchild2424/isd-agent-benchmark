  "title": "[Large-Scale] Workplace Language Competency Enhancement Course for Professionals Using Emergency Remote Education in the Pandemic Era",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic language proficiency (reading, listening, speaking, writing), comprehension of job-related terminology and specialized vocabulary, and basic operational skills for digital learning tools (video conferencing systems, cloud document editing)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Digital-based real-time interactive education accounting for limited physical contact during pandemics, focusing on improving learners' job-contextual language proficiency (grammatical accuracy, technical terminology application, cultural context comprehension). Particularly integrates non-verbal communication (gestures, facial expressions) and text-based strategies (emojis, abbreviations) in remote settings to maximize educational effectiveness.",
    "institution_type": "Vocational training institution",
    "learner_age": "40s and above",
    "learner_education": "Adult learner (non-degree)",
    "learner_role": "Office worker (administrative/management)",
    "domain_expertise": "Beginner"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can improve professional vocabulary usage and situational expressiveness (grammatical accuracy, cultural context reflection) in three or more job-related communication scenarios (meetings, negotiations, presentations) by practicing with online collaboration tools (e.g., Google Docs, Slack).",
    "Learners can enhance pronunciation accuracy (phoneme-level) and intonation naturalness (intonation patterns) by 20% through voice recognition feedback systems and peer evaluation in digital environments, while conducting self-assessments using real-time correction features.",
    "Learners can establish a self-directed learning plan (balanced reading/writing/speaking + job context analysis) three or more times per week using online learning platforms (e.g., Google Classroom, Zoom) under pandemic constraints, achieve over 80% execution rates within a week, and maintain reflective journals (including language usage pattern analysis)."
