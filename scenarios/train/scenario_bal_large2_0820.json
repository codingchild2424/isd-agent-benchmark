    "Physicians will (1) interpret LDL/HDL/triglyceride metrics with 80% accuracy based on real test results, (2) present at least four types of dietary/exercise/medication recommendations differentiated by patient conditions (obesity/diabetes/hypertension, etc.), and (3) apply the five-stage motivational interviewing (MI) technique (rapport building → exploring change → addressing resistance → enhancing self-efficacy → planning) to develop personalized patient management plans in at least four of five simulated counseling scenarios",
    "Through at least three role-playing exercises, learners will apply patient behavior change techniques (motivational interviewing, empathetic listening, etc.), achieve an average score of 4.0 or higher (5-point scale) on a peer evaluation rubric (communication, empathy, technique application), and submit revised practice reports reflecting improvements",
    "By analyzing real clinical cases, they identify barriers to implementing preventive medicine activities and develop solution strategies."
