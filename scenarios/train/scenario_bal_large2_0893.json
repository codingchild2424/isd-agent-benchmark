  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Master’s degree or higher, foundational research methodology knowledge (including quantitative/qualitative analysis), professional practice experience, basic academic writing and language analysis competencies (vocabulary selection, text structure comprehension, grammatical application)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "An intensive workshop where current professionals collaboratively engage in a cohort model to systematically acquire the process of writing language research papers. Participants strengthen specialized competencies in language research, including text analysis (qualitative/quantitative), academic terminology usage (domain-specific vocabulary), and clear expression of research findings (logical coherence, grammatical accuracy). It particularly addresses complex issues in real educational settings, such as multicultural comparative studies or language policy analysis.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will collaboratively create a step-by-step roadmap from selecting a language research topic to data analysis with cohort members, ensuring scientific rigor in variable control and hypothesis formulation during research design.",
    "Learners will use an integrated thesis guidance model (LLM) to analyze three language education research papers by: (1) evaluating research design structure (five core elements: research question, methodology, analysis, conclusion, limitations), (2) summarizing literature reviews (under 500 words, emphasizing key terms and concepts), and (3) writing result interpretation reports (three key findings, integrating statistical and textual analysis). They must submit outcomes meeting at least four of five rubric criteria within four weeks.",
    "Learners will develop strategies to optimize time management and workload based on peer feedback and instructor support, enhancing academic expression and logical coherence in research papers. Specifically, they will improve clarity and persuasiveness in language research through grammatical accuracy, specialized terminology, and complex sentence structures."
