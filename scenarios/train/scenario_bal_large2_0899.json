  "title": "[Large-scale] Integrated Lesson Study (LS) and Domain-Specific Competency (DSC) Training Program for Enhancing Mathematics Teachers' Professional Expertise: Strengthening Problem-Solving and Conceptual Proof Capabilities",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Secondary mathematics core theories (algebra, geometry, probability & statistics), mathematical proof methodologies, and at least three years of teaching experience (required: polynomial operations, statistical estimation, geometric proofs)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Practical training for in-service math teachers based on the LS-DSC framework. It includes hands-on practice with digital whiteboards and tablets for equation writing (LaTeX), graph analysis (Desmos integration), and statistical visualization (basic Excel/R). It reinforces visual representation of proof processes and error case analysis.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Enhance the ability to improve lesson design for solving mathematical problems and proving concepts using LS and DSC tools (strengthening equation/function modeling, geometric proofs, probabilistic reasoning).",
    "Strengthen the competency to evaluate the appropriateness of formula application and graph interpretation in mathematics instruction by analyzing students' cognitive needs (interpreting quadratic function graphs, statistical distributions, and logical errors in proofs).",
    "Develop strategies for reflective practice-based lesson analysis and computational error prevention (building an error pattern database, designing a step-by-step feedback system for proof processes)."
