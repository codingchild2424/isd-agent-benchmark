  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Science subject matter expertise (experimental design, variable control, data analysis), basic pedagogical knowledge, understanding of scientific inquiry process (observation-hypothesis-experiment-analysis-conclusion)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A blended education program combining smartphone-based mobile learning with face-to-face workshops, providing flexible learning environments tailored to working professionals. Learners strengthen lesson design capabilities using scientific analysis tools (graph generation, statistical processing) and digital evidence collection methods (photo/video materials, experimental data logging).",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners propose lesson design plans integrating science content knowledge (PCK) and general pedagogical knowledge (PPK), incorporating experimental/observational processes with variable control, hypothesis formulation, and data analysis.",
    "Over a mid-term course (4 weeks), learners design two teaching strategies applying both PPK (pedagogical content knowledge) and PCK (science teaching knowledge) in real classroom settings (3 experimental lessons), meet four or more of five variable control checklist items, and submit lesson plans reflecting the scientific inquiry process (observation-hypothesis-experiment-analysis-conclusion).",
    "Learners revise their knowledge integration strategies three or more times based on peer assessment feedback and draft an evidence-based research plan with 80% or higher completion using the revised strategies, incorporating quantitative and qualitative analysis of experimental data."
