  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic design principles (composition, balance, contrast) and foundational language structures (grammar, vocabulary, discourse). Experience with digital tools (e.g., Adobe Illustrator)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A Project-Based Learning Environment Where Students/Career Seekers Solve Real-World Language Design Problems (Branding, Publications, Digital Content). Focuses on enhancing learners' visual expression skills and information delivery efficiency, with the goal of developing multimodal (text + visual) communication competencies. Includes assessments of design adaptability based on the target audience's language proficiency",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will develop text-based design solutions by applying the five stages of the language design process (problem definition, idea sketching, prototyping, user testing, iterative improvement), particularly strengthening the integration of grammatical structures and lexical choices with visual elements.",
    "Using online collaboration tools (Figma, Miro), learners will exchange real-time design feedback on typography and layout with team members, applying clear expression and critical reading skills.",
    "Learners will concretize language visual materials (typography, layout, color systems) according to project requirements and target readers’ literacy levels, linguistic backgrounds, and cultural contexts, focusing on information hierarchy and visual readability optimization."
