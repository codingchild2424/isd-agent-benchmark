  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic understanding of English learner education standards, instructional design experience, foundational grammar and vocabulary proficiency, text analysis skills, and introductory knowledge of narrative research methodologies",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Project-based learning in digitally supported environments for practicing professionals requires formative assessment-centered feedback structures. Essential to design activities for improving learners’ expressive (oral/written) and reading comprehension skills. Peer assessments emphasize integrated evaluation of grammar, vocabulary, and communication abilities.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners compare and analyze three key differences between WIDA standards and state-developed standards, design two standard application strategies suitable for vocational training contexts (e.g., English learner vocational programs), and write a report meeting at least four of five peer evaluation rubric items (including grammar, vocabulary, communication skills assessment, and text structure analysis).",
    "Learners collect three English learner leadership cases in vocational training settings using narrative research methods (interviews, observations, case studies) and write a 10–12-page APA-formatted report (introduction-methods-results-discussion) including: (1) case-specific analysis (at least two text-based communication strategies and vocabulary patterns), (2) three field-applicable improvement plans (including grammar/expressiveness strategies), and (3) one ethical consideration. The report must score ≥80% on an institutional rubric (40% analytical depth, 30% practicality, 30% format adherence).",
    "Develop and simulate standard-based assessment tools (integrating reading-writing-listening evaluation and grammar-vocabulary accuracy analysis) through project-based learning (PBL), with mandatory activity design for improving learners’ reading comprehension and expressive skills."
