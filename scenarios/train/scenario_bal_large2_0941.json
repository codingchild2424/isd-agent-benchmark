  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic mathematics knowledge (statistics, probability, graph interpretation, regression analysis) and experimental design methodology. Requires understanding of descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, variance), inferential statistics (t-tests, ANOVA, correlation/regression analysis), and mathematical modeling",

    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",

    "additional_context": "Learners access the LMS via personal devices (BYOD), with project-based assessments measuring learning outcomes. Designed as a beginner-level mathematics curriculum, it experimentally verifies the impact of instructors' visual and auditory presentation styles on learning effectiveness. The course emphasizes evidence-based education, with all results interpreted through mathematical rigor (hypothesis testing, effect size calculation, model fit evaluation) and educational practicality (strategy prioritization). Statistical processing using SPSS or R/Python is required for data analysis.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will collect training data from ≥10 participants per image type (original/idealized/virtual/none) to analyze changes in learning achievement, perform t-tests or ANOVA, and visualize significant differences (p-value < 0.05) using quantitative graphs (bar/box plots). They will also evaluate the validity of the experimental design while controlling mathematical variables (sample size, variance, etc.).",
    "Learners will perform descriptive statistics (mean, SD, variance) and correlation analysis on 3 voice types (original/altered/synthetic), derive ≥2 significant correlations (p-value < 0.05) between voice quality (clarity, speed) and learning satisfaction, and propose a 5-level priority for voice expression strategies. Correlation coefficients must meet Pearson’s r ≥ 0.3 or Spearman’s ρ ≥ 0.3.",
    "Learners will measure perceived social presence and academic emotions (boredom, immersion) by image/voice type, model data via multiple regression analysis (e.g., Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + ε), derive an educational effectiveness formula (e.g., Learning Achievement = 0.45*Image Score + 0.32*Voice Score + 1.2), and report the model’s explanatory power (R² ≥ 0.2)."
