    "Learners can selectively utilize productive failure (PS-I) and explicit instruction (I-PS) strategies based on situational contexts during problem-solving processes.",
    "Learners select and clearly explain at least three given biochemical concepts (e.g., enzyme reactions, cellular respiration) in a corporate report (2 pages) or presentation (5 slides) for a PBL assignment and obtain a suitability score of over 80% from peer evaluation (3 reviewers) and expert review."
