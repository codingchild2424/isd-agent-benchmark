    "Through flipped learning, learners will self-directively master at least 80% of core occupational therapy theories (professional reasoning, procedural knowledge) and apply mathematical calculations (e.g., medication dosage calculation, statistical analysis of treatment effects) in problem-solving processes.",
    "In a blended learning environment, learners will analyze three real clinical cases using PBL, apply a five-step problem-solving process (problem definition → data collection → mathematical modeling → calculation verification → result interpretation) to each case, submit a 10–15-page project report by the deadline, and achieve an \"excellent\" grade in at least four of the five rubric criteria.",
    "Perform at least three occupational therapy simulation tasks (e.g., patient data pattern analysis, probability calculation of treatment effects) utilizing gamification elements (quests, badges, leaderboards).",
    "Write and incorporate peer evaluations and feedback at least five times using digital tools (apps, online platforms) and share analysis results utilizing data visualization (graphs, tables)."
