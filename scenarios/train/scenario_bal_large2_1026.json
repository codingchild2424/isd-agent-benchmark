    "Learners can identify computational thinking indicators (problem decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition, algorithm design, generalization) with over 80% accuracy during mathematical problem-solving",
    "Learners can design scoring rubrics to assess students' computational thinking levels in VR-based simulation environments",
    "Learners can apply 4 computational thinking indicators (decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, algorithms) to a math class case (calculus concept explanation) and draft a 3–5-page lesson design plan. They can receive ≥4/5 scores in ≥2 out of 3 peer evaluation rubric criteria (clarity, creativity, practicality) and improve based on feedback."
