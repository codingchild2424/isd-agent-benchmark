  "learning_goals": [
    "Improve ability to deliver 5+ minute English presentations in science workplace scenarios (e.g., experiment results, research data analysis) with emphasis on scientific evidence presentation and conclusion derivation",
    "In English discussions with peer practitioners on variable control and hypothesis testing methods, identify 80%+ of core arguments and meet four or more of five discussion checklist items across three or more sessions—focusing on observational data interpretation and analytical comparison",
    "Perform 10 scenario-based role-plays simulating corporate environments (meetings, presentations, negotiations) and demonstrate natural English conversation meeting clarity (4+/5) and contextual appropriateness (4+/5) in peer/instructor evaluations—especially emphasizing ability to clearly explain measurement methods and analytical techniques in scientific evidence presentation"
