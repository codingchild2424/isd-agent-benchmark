  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Experience in basic maker activities, digital tool proficiency, understanding of social interaction and civic rights, and introductory project management concepts",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Applies gamification and personalized learning design in project-based assessments, fostering civic awareness and community connectivity. The curriculum includes maker activities reflecting historical/geographical contexts, exploring intercultural collaboration and institutional support mechanisms.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "During maker projects, learners regularly self-assess 21st-century citizen competencies (creativity, collaboration, critical thinking) within the context of civic rights and social relationships.",
    "Using gamification elements (level-ups, badges, point rewards), learners write competency development plans ≥3 times weekly for two weeks, submit reflection journals incorporating ≥2 peer feedbacks, and devise community problem-solving solutions applying intercultural collaboration strategies.",
    "Learners select one of two fields (woodworking or 3D modeling) for a 3-week period, set individual maker learning goals, create a weekly plan including activities, time spent, and resource lists, achieve at least 80% of the weekly checklist, and submit a final prototype or report evaluated on three criteria (creativity, feasibility, completeness) with at least two criteria rated as \"Average\" (Grade B) or higher. Additionally, in a 5-minute presentation, they must concretely propose solutions linked to community issues (e.g., recycling resource utilization, public space improvement) considering historical and geographical contexts."
