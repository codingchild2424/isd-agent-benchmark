  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic instructional design theory and experience with online educational tools, intermediate or higher proficiency in target language grammar and vocabulary, and fundamental digital literacy (ability to utilize text and voice input/output functions)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Strengthening language education content design competencies in smartphone-accessible microlearning environments: Focuses on designing effective vocabulary presentation (using visual association techniques) and pronunciation training modules (integrating speech waveform analysis tools) within limited screen sizes. Requires interface design that simultaneously considers learners’ writing and listening comprehension abilities.",
    "institution_type": "Vocational training institution",
    "learner_age": "In their 20s",
    "learner_education": "University",
    "learner_role": "Office worker (administrative/management)",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can identify over 80% of core elements of mobile-optimized online language courses (e.g., real-time pronunciation feedback systems, multimedia materials for vocabulary reinforcement, context-based grammar exercises).",
    "Learners can propose at least three text-voice interaction design solutions feasible in limited technological environments (smartphone-only), such as chat-based grammar correction, speech recognition conversation training, and scenario-based vocabulary expansion quizzes.",
    "Within one week, learners can develop a language learning module prototype (e.g., business conversation training app interface) applicable to real-world work environments through project-based assessment and achieve over 70 points (out of 100) on an evaluation rubric (functionality 30%, practicality 30%, creativity 20%, completeness 20%). The prototype must be designed to simultaneously enhance learners’ reading comprehension and expressive skills."
