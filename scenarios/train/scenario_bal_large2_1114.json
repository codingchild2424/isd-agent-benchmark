  "title": "[Large-Scale] Co-Parenting Competency Strengthening Program for Prospective Parents: Decision-Making Training Based on Mathematical Modeling (Applying Probability, Optimization, and Graph Theory)",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic parenting concepts, foundational awareness as prospective parents, simple mathematical calculation skills (solving equations, graph interpretation), and grasp of basic statistical concepts (mean, ratios)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Provides a blended learning environment combining online/offline sessions for time-constrained working learners. Utilizes collaboration tools (shared spreadsheets, graphing tools, simulation software) in BYOD settings. Includes training in applying mathematical modeling (probability models, optimization techniques, graph theory) to parenting-related decision-making problems. Strengthens modeling practice using real-case data.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will explain core principles of co-parenting (e.g., role allocation ratios, communication efficiency formulas) with ≥80% accuracy, applying ratio calculations and function modeling techniques.",
    "In simulated scenarios, learners will evaluate probabilistic approaches (conditional probability, decision trees) for conflict resolution and linear programming models (constraints, objective functions) for parenting plans in ≥3 practical exercises.",
    "Learners will collaboratively draft a real-world-applicable parenting agreement through project-based learning, incorporating resource optimization graphs (network analysis) and decision tree models (expected value calculations) with peer/lecturer feedback."
