    "During the mid-term course (2–4 weeks), learners collaboratively explain three complex mathematical concepts (e.g., differential equations, matrix operations) with peers via an online discussion platform and weekly face-to-face sessions, achieving ≥4/5 points on a peer evaluation rubric (clarity, logical consistency, interaction).",
    "Learners can systematically analyze mathematical problems in workplace environments and propose solutions through project-based assessments."
