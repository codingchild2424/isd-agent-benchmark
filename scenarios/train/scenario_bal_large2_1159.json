    "Through problem-solving activities based on experiential learning theory, learners independently solve over 70% of complex mathematical problems (function optimization, statistical inference).",
    "Learners can design a math modeling project reflecting real-world job scenarios (e.g., construction site budgeting, manufacturing process optimization) in four-person teams, finalize reports incorporating peer collaborative learning (weekly peer reviews) and instructor feedback (three times at two-week intervals), and receive a score of 3.5 or higher on a 5-point scale for applicability from a field expert evaluation panel."
