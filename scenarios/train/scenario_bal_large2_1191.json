  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Fundamental knowledge of exercise physiology and energy metabolism concepts, basic awareness of health-related social systems (e.g., public health policies, community health programs), foundational understanding of how social determinants affect health",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learners access content on-the-go via mobile devices, engage in social media-based discussions, and complete case-based projects. Focuses on fostering civic responsibility through community health promotion cases (e.g., urban park development, health equity policies). Explores how cultural/geographical factors influence health behaviors.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners cultivate the ability to accurately explain physiological mechanisms of aerobic/anaerobic energy systems by at least 80% and analyze the social significance of physical activity and health promotion in relation to civic rights.",
    "Within one week, learners select three types of physical activities (walking, running, stair climbing, etc.), measure energy expenditure per activity, visualize the data as a concept map, and analyze two or more energy consumption patterns (e.g., differences by activity intensity). They also propose institutional solutions to address health inequalities in the community.",
    "Within one week, learners apply scientific principles (muscle growth, aerobic exercise intensity, nutrition intake, etc.) to develop a 4-week personalized fitness plan. They achieve an average of 4/5 or higher on a peer assessment rubric and include cultural/economic strategies to mitigate health disparities in the planning process."
