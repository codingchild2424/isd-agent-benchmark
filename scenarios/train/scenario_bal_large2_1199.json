All outputs are evaluated simultaneously for mathematical accuracy and linguistic clarity (grammar, vocabulary, text structure). Peer evaluations emphasize feedback specificity, expression appropriateness, and linguistic accuracy. Learners' reading comprehension, expression, and writing skills are comprehensively assessed.",

    "Applying the four-stage TE-RME framework (exploration, expansion, reorganization, evaluation), learners design two math problems reflecting one cultural context (e.g., Korean holidays, Western festivals), achieving over 80% suitability in peer/expert reviews. Problems must ensure clarity, linguistic accuracy (grammar, vocabulary, text structure), and enhance learners' reading comprehension and expressive skills",
    "Learners complete three or more digital tool-based (GeoGebra, Padlet, etc.) mathematical competency assessment tasks, improving oral/written explanation skills (presentations, writing, logical expression)",
    "Learners finalize one math lesson design plan incorporating three or more peer feedback rounds, explicitly including five questions, three explanations, and two feedback strategies for linguistic interaction during teaching-learning processes, submitted within 24 hours post-course. All linguistic outputs must demonstrate educational context-appropriate expression and accuracy"
