  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will explain solid particle characterization and process design principles using chemical engineering terminology and academic discourse structures and apply them to technical documents/report text types.",
    "Learners will collaboratively develop chemical engineering solid operation education scenarios with peer teachers and utilize effective communication strategies (academic discussions, presentations, feedback) in academic discourse communities.",
    "Learners design educational modules utilizing social constructivist-based pedagogical approaches (academic discussions, case study presentations, feedback cycles) and develop instructional materials that reflect disciplinary discourse characteristics (technical text structures, academic vocabulary usage)."
