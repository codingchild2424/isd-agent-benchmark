    "Learners can analyze three real-world engineering problems (e.g., bridge design, fluid dynamics simulation, structural vibration analysis) through six months of collaborative problem-based learning (CPBL), apply a five-stage design process (problem definition → idea generation → prototyping → testing → improvement) per team, write a final report, and pass the presentation evaluation by scoring over 80 points based on the rubric (problem-solving completeness 30%, creativity 20%, team collaboration 20%, report clarity 15%, presentation delivery 15%).",
    "Learners can set self-directed learning plans at least twice weekly over four weeks in a flipped learning environment using provided video lectures (8) and materials, achieve over 80% accuracy on weekly quizzes (5 questions), and submit a final project report for performance evaluation."
