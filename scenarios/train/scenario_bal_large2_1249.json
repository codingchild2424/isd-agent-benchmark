  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Elementary special education knowledge, understanding of general teaching methodologies, and basic mathematics instruction experience (fraction concepts, equation solving, graph interpretation). Comprehension of fundamental mathematical formulas and proof methods",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course for in-service or pre-service teachers to develop customized math education systems reflecting the cognitive and learning characteristics of autistic children. Focuses on improving fraction concept understanding through visual support, equation modeling, and graph interpretation skills. All design processes are simultaneously validated for mathematical rigor and educational effectiveness.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Design three or more math education content prototypes reflecting visual learning characteristics of autistic children (including fraction concept visualization, equation modeling, graph interpretation tools) – each prototype implements mathematical formula application and variable adjustment functions",
    "Learners apply three key principles of multimedia cognitive learning theory (visual-auditory integration, attention-focusing mechanisms, multiple representation theory) to establish a 4-week development plan for an interactive educational tool (prototype) enhancing elementary students' understanding of fraction concepts and can receive validity recognition of 4 points or higher (5-point scale) from an expert evaluation panel – the plan includes probabilistic learning effect measurement indicators",
    "Within a 6-month course, learners select one VHDLS framework-based math education design case for a PBL team project (4 members per team) and (1) apply three math education design principles (concreteness principle, gradual complexity principle, feedback principle), (2) develop a 5-item evaluation rubric (creativity, mathematical accuracy, user-friendliness, visual effectiveness, educational validity), (3) write a 15-page report integrating three or more visual elements (graphs/diagrams), and perform a 10-minute presentation with Q&A – the report includes statistical analysis results",
    "Propose five or more visual element integration strategies to enhance attention span in autistic children (color contrast, animation speed adjustment, pattern repetition, graph utilization, formula visualization) – each strategy undergoes mathematical proof feasibility review"
