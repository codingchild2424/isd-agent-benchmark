  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Designing a survey tool based on five sub-elements (self-regulated learning, cognitive strategy use, experiential emotion, teacher-student interaction, school life enjoyment) to measure student engagement in blended learning environments",
    "To validate content validity of a developed measurement tool, learners conduct a procedure to obtain a Content Validity Index (CVI) of 0.8 or higher from a panel of five or more experts. They also execute pre- and post-test procedures to achieve a Cronbach’s α coefficient of 0.7 or higher for reliability assessment.",
    "Learners select ten participation measurement indicators applicable to blended (online/face-to-face) classrooms, document evaluation criteria (e.g., 5-point Likert scale) and usage guidelines for each, and receive practicality feedback from three or more institutional teachers."
