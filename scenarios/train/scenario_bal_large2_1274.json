  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic information retrieval skills, document handling experience, and foundational grammar/text comprehension abilities. Specifically requires experience evaluating vocabulary levels and contextual appropriateness when analyzing educational materials",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",

    "additional_context": "Emphasizing reflective practice for elementary school teachers to solve real-world information problems in their work environment. Providing an integrated reading-writing learning environment with smartphone-optimized accessibility design. Includes training in evaluating vocabulary level and contextual appropriateness when analyzing educational materials. Establishing a feedback system to improve learners' critical thinking and expression skills",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can explain at least three criteria (reliability, validity, appropriateness) for evaluating educational materials and critically assess core content through text structure analysis. They particularly strengthen analytical skills considering vocabulary selection and contextual coherence.",
    "Learners systematically collect required information during lesson preparation using a four-stage search strategy (keyword selection, source evaluation, cross-checking, meta-analysis) and can compare and analyze research methodologies and conclusions of academic papers. This process cultivates logical flow and evidence-based conclusion-drawing skills.",
    "By the end of the six-month course, learners can write a self-assessment report (900–1,100 characters) based on online resource search and academic paper analysis experiences. They must incorporate at least two improvement points—averaging over 4 points (on a 5-point scale) from peer feedback on vocabulary use, logical structure, and clarity of expression—and submit a final report emphasizing grammatical accuracy and text cohesion."
