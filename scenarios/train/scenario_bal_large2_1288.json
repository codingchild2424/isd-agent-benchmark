They design one personalized visual training program including 3 core elements (goal setting, training methods, evaluation metrics) and analyze treatment efficacy by applying a visual tracking accuracy measurement process to 5 virtual patient datasets, demonstrating ≥15% average improvement.",
    "Learners analyze visual impairment diagnostic data (visual acuity, intraocular pressure, retinal images) to establish ≥3 prevention/treatment plans (medication, laser therapy, rehabilitation training) and create patient-specific management checklists within 2 weeks."
