  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational engineering concepts, experience using engineering tools, and basic understanding of the scientific method (hypothesis formulation, variable control, experimental design, data analysis, evidence-based conclusions)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Simulation/VR-based",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Customizable modular design for current practitioners, emphasizing learning flexibility and autonomy. Systematically applies scientific inquiry processes for engineering problem-solving in simulation/VR environments. Strengthens practical competencies through a step-by-step approach (observation, measurement, analysis, conclusion), with particular emphasis on variable control in experimental design to ensure scientific rigor.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can independently design engineering education modules applying the five phases of the ADDIE model and verify inter-modular connectivity through the scientific inquiry method (hypothesis setting→experiment→analysis→conclusion).",
    "Learners can develop three or more module-specific learning scenarios in simulation/VR environments and optimize educational effectiveness through independent/dependent variable control and experimental design.",
    "During a 2–4 week mid-term course, learners can establish a project plan linking three or more modules (e.g., data analysis, system design, prototyping) and pass project-based assessment by scoring 70+ points on predefined evaluation criteria (connectivity 40%, scalability 30%, feasibility 30%). Additionally, they systematically analyze experimental data to derive evidence-based conclusions."
