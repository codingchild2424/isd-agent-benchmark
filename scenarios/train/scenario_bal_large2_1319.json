    "Learners can apply data augmentation techniques (rotation, resizing, brightness adjustment) and preprocessing (noise removal, contrast enhancement, Canny edge detection) to small image datasets (<1,000 images) within 6 months, improve model accuracy by ≥15%, and submit experimental results as a report.",
    "Learners can implement a hybrid model combining SVM classifiers with LSTM/Transformer-based deep learning models on 5 public datasets, achieve ≥85% average accuracy via 5-fold cross-validation, and demonstrate ≥5% performance improvement over single models through hyperparameter tuning.",
    "Learners can calculate performance metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, AUC) for a medical image classification model (based on lung cancer CT image datasets), explain ≥3 clinical implications of each metric, and propose 2 model improvement strategies based on analysis."
