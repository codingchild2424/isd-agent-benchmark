  "title": "Intermediate Java-based object-oriented programming course: Software design and performance analysis based on scientific inquiry methodology",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic programming syntax, experience in designing simple algorithms, foundational grasp of scientific methodologies (basic experimental design and data analysis), and basic comprehension of software performance metrics (CPU usage, memory leaks, etc.)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A practical programming competency enhancement program for corporate R&D managers, requiring mobile environment-optimized design. Models the software development process as a scientific experiment, approaching code changes as controlled variable experiments and emphasizing methodologies for measuring/analyzing performance metrics (response time, throughput, error rate, etc.). Experimental design mandates control group setup and repeated measurements.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Implement and analyze performance variables in at least three real-world cases applying Java’s OOP paradigms (inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction) according to scientific inquiry methodologies (hypothesis formulation, experimental design, data analysis).",
    "Learners can manage source code with three or more team members using Git collaboration tools (e.g., GitHub, GitLab), compare version changes (at least five commits), derive two performance optimization strategies, and measure execution time/memory usage per commit.",
    "Learners must develop a small-scale web application with REST API integration (implementing at least three CRUD functions) within three weeks, perform API testing (five request/response validations) via Postman, complete unit testing (70%+ code coverage), and document experimental results (including API response time/error rates) systematically in Jira/Confluence for team leader approval.",
    "Learners can conduct two two-week sprints, set three hypotheses per sprint, develop and validate MVPs, write incremental improvement reports meeting over 80% feedback incorporation, and perform A/B testing with comparative analysis for hypothesis verification."
