  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic Spanish communication skills (daily conversational level), understanding of early childhood education practices, foundational knowledge of multilingual learners' language development stages, and basic grammar terminology/text analysis skills",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course emphasizing the development of translanguaging strategies applicable to early Spanish language education for current practitioners. Aims to enhance learners' metalinguistic awareness and intercultural communication skills, with a focus on maximizing cross-linguistic transfer effects through vocabulary expansion and comparative analysis of grammatical systems.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "In early Spanish education settings, learners acquire the ability to design interlingual transfer lessons using translanguaging techniques, integrating comparative grammar system analysis and vocabulary expansion strategies.",
    "Learners develop one integrated vocabulary-grammar learning module using at least three Spanish-English bilingual resources from an OER platform, submitting results that meet four or more of five evaluation checklist criteria: textual coherence, expression accuracy, cultural appropriateness, interaction facilitation, and learning objective achievement.",
    "Learners design one assessment tool applying connection strategies between their native language (Korean) and target language (English), earning 4+ points (5-point scale) in the 'criterion validity' category from at least two of three peer evaluators. The tool must include text analysis (grammar error identification, vocabulary diversity assessment) and expression accuracy (sentence structure, cultural context reflection) items."
