  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational medical knowledge and experience in medical imaging interpretation, basic vocabulary for clinical report writing and patient records, and introductory understanding of specialized terminology and grammatical structures required in healthcare settings",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Practical-oriented training for medical service managers/leaders in corporate settings, focusing on acquiring field-applicable POCUS skills. Emphasizes strengthening language competencies for effective communication between medical and manufacturing fields (medical terminology usage, report writing, presentation skills). Integrates text analysis, writing, and presentation training to comprehensively enhance learners' expressive, reading, and communication abilities.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "When evaluating five emergency clinical scenarios (trauma, obstetrics, infection, etc.) using POCUS equipment in low-resource settings, learners can achieve scientific communication skills linking patient symptoms to imaging results, emphasizing accuracy in medical terminology and structured expression.",
    "Under limited resource conditions, learners can cultivate the ability to achieve over 80% diagnostic accuracy applying POCUS protocols and write structured reports (patient status, findings, recommendations) using medical vocabulary and grammar, with clear text organization evaluated.",
    "Within one week, learners must write an implementation plan to introduce a POCUS education system into a corporate field (e.g., manufacturing/medical settings) and score at least 12 points (out of 15) on three criteria (feasibility, budget efficiency, field applicability) during a 5-minute presentation. Reports must include specialized medical terminology and clear expressions, with logical articulation and persuasive language assessed during the presentation."
