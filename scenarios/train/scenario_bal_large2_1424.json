  "title": "[Large-Scale] Enhancing Social Science Academic Writing Skills with Generative AI Support: Application of Research Methodology and Critical Analysis",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic academic writing structures, foundational social science research methodologies (variable analysis, hypothesis formulation, civic rights concepts), smartphone proficiency, and basic comprehension of historical context and institutional analysis",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Project-based learning utilizing smartphones in limited technological settings. Learners apply generative AI tools to academic writing tasks on real-world social science research topics (e.g., changes in civic rights in the digital age, global economic inequality, comparative political systems). They perform critical analyses considering cultural validity and social impact.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can systematically design three or more stages (planning-drafting-revision) of the entire academic writing process based on social science research methodologies (problem definition-hypothesis setting-variable control) using generative AI tools and explore the relationship between civic rights and institutional analysis.",
    "Learners can enhance critical analysis skills in social sciences by applying five or more criteria (historical context, cultural validity, institutional analysis, political implications, social impact) to evaluate the academic suitability of AI-generated content and perform multidimensional interpretations of global inequality cases.",
    "Graduate students can complete three weekly social science academic writing assignments using AI tools (Grammarly, Hemingway Editor) in mobile environments, achieve ≥80% implementation fidelity (based on task submission completion rate and feedback incorporation) over six months by reflecting weekly planning (time allocation compliance ≥80%) and tool-specific optimization strategies (three or more applications), and apply empirical data to research on changes in civic rights in the digital age."
