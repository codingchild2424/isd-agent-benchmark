  "title": "[Large-scale] Development of an IMS LD-based Language Learning Design Engine: Integrated Optimization of Grammar, Vocabulary, and Listening, and Strengthening Expression and Reading Comprehension Competencies",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational language learning experience (grammar, vocabulary, listening, speaking) and digital device proficiency, along with basic comprehension of text analysis and expression techniques (writing, presentation)",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course focused on implementing integrated language learning flows (reading/writing/listening/speaking) using IMS LD standards in smartphone-centric limited-technology environments. Includes personalized feedback systems to improve learners’ expressive and reading comprehension skills. Evidence-based optimization strategies are established through learning data analysis.",
    "institution_type": "Corporate/Enterprise",
    "learner_age": "Teens (13-19)",
    "learner_education": "University",
    "learner_role": "Professional (medical/legal/technical)",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners must explain the basic principles of IMS LD-based learning design and language learning components (grammar, vocabulary, listening, expression, reading, etc.) according to scientific inquiry procedures.",
    "Learners must simulate integrated language learning flows (reading–writing–speaking) using Petri net models and evaluate learning efficiency through text structure analysis.",
    "Learners must flexibly modify a learning design engine based on open architecture and implement customized learning paths for language domains (grammar, vocabulary, listening, expression, reading).",
    "Learners must analyze monthly formative assessment results, identify two or more language domains (grammar, vocabulary, listening, etc.) with error rates over 30%, and create an optimization plan increasing weekly practice frequency (writing exercises, vocabulary quizzes, listening assessments, reading drills) by at least one session per week."
