  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic fire safety knowledge and first-aid awareness, comprehension of situational language expressions (imperatives, warnings, explanations, instructions, reports, etc.), and recognition of vocabulary and grammatical structures required in emergencies",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A VR simulation-based fire response training project in smartphone-limited environments, focusing on simultaneously enhancing situational awareness and language skills (reading, writing, listening, expression). Stresses effective communication training in emergencies, requiring command/warning texts and specialized terminology.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Perform core procedures (‘reporting request’, ‘evacuation guidance’, ‘fire extinguisher use’) in a VR fire scenario with 80% accuracy, and appropriately use command, warning, and explanatory expressions.",
    "Identify hazard zones and plan evacuation routes based on fire spread pattern analysis, improving team communication skills (instructions, reports, confirmations).",
    "Apply role division and collaboration strategies in team-based simulations to real situations, developing communication skills using fire safety terminology (fire class, evacuation signal, emergency procedures, etc.)."
