  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "No foundational accounting concepts. However, possesses basic daily reading/writing skills and simple text analysis abilities. Requires motivation for specialized terminology learning",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Most learners balance work and study, necessitating flexible learning environments via mobile devices. The curriculum design focuses on accurate understanding of accounting terminology and enhancing linguistic expression skills. It emphasizes strengthening contextual usage of professional terms through text-based materials and video content.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can explain the meanings of basic accounting terms (journal entries, ledger, financial statements, etc.) in linguistic contexts with over 80% accuracy and demonstrate writing/oral expression using specialized terminology.",
    "Learners will complete pre-learning content (text/video) via mobile devices at least twice weekly through a flipped learning system, achieve a quiz pass rate of over 70%, verbally explain core concepts, and develop the ability to construct simple sentences using specialized terms from video lectures.",
    "In a 2-week project-based assessment, learners will analyze real-life household accounting cases (monthly income/expenses with 10+ items), create 3–5-page PPT presentations applying double-entry accounting principles (5 core concepts: balance principle, account classification, journal entries, ledger recording, trial balance), and earn over 4 points (5-point scale) in \"clarity\" and \"applicability\" from at least two of three peer evaluators. Presentations must accurately use 5+ double-entry accounting terms (e.g., debit/credit, journal, trial balance) and will be evaluated for logical structure and appropriate terminology."
