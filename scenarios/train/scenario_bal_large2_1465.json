  "title": "[Large-Scale] Language and Cognitive Development Course Through Studio-Based Engineering Design Education: Strengthening Multimodal Communication",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic engineering design concepts, professional communication skills in specialized fields (grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation), experience with digital tools, and foundational technical writing competencies",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Simulation/VR-based",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Implementing a collaborative learning environment using VR simulations in a smartphone-centric, limited technological setting. Learners integrate nonverbal expressions (gestures, spatial awareness) and verbal interactions (voice/text) in virtual spaces to document design processes, developing multimodal communication skills. Particularly, they cultivate the ability to systematically record and share project progress by combining diverse modes of expression, such as voice commands, text annotations, and visual feedback.",
    "institution_type": "Vocational training institution",
    "learner_age": "In their 20s",
    "learner_education": "Adult learner (non-degree)",
    "learner_role": "Professional (medical/legal/technical)",
    "domain_expertise": "Beginner"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners improve creative problem-solving and technical writing skills through team-based design projects in VR studio environments. They strengthen abilities to produce project documents using specialized terminology and accurate grammatical structures",
    "Learners identify the 4 core elements (goals, knowledge, skills, values) of the Engineering Epistemic Framework (EF) by incorporating ≥3 peer feedback sessions and ≥2 weekly practices. They deliver 5-minute project explanations using ≥10 specialized terms, applying logical structuring and effective expression strategies",
    "Using digital collaboration tools (Figma, Notion, Google Docs), learners complete ≥80% of real-time communication records (minutes, annotations) for 2 design projects. They produce ≥3 types of project documents (requirements specifications, wireframes, user scenarios) following standard templates, maintaining consistent terminology and clear sentence structures across documents"
