  "title": "[Large-scale] Intermediate Practitioner Competency Enhancement Program for AI-Integrated Medical Simulation Education: Developing Social Responsibility and Patient-Centered Decision-Making Skills",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational medical knowledge and practical experience, basic understanding of social determinants of health (SDOH), and introductory knowledge of patient rights (access to care, right to information, right to choose) and medical ethics (autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A digital device-enabled educational environment emphasizing project-based collaborative learning. It includes scenarios for community health promotion and health equity improvement, multidisciplinary team (medical staff, social workers, public health experts) collaboration simulations, and multicultural patient cases for cultural competency enhancement.",
    "institution_type": "Public/Non-profit educational institution",
    "learner_age": "In their 30s",
    "learner_education": "Middle school",
    "learner_role": "Professional (medical/legal/technical)",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Perform 90% accurate assessments reflecting social determinants of health (SDOH) and ethical considerations in emergency patient evaluation processes using AI-based simulation tools.",
    "Improve the ability to develop treatment plans considering cultural contexts and patient rights (e.g., medical accessibility, right to information) by 40% through analysis of virtual patient data.",
    "Learners can improve decision-making processes three or more times using AI feedback tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot) in team-based simulation projects (e.g., disaster response simulations) over four weeks, incorporate improvements into a five-page report reflecting civil rights and medical ethics standards (e.g., patient autonomy, justice principles), and achieve an \"excellent\" grade in two or more of four report evaluation criteria (clarity, analytical depth, feasibility, societal impact)."
