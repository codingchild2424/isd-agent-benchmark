  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic organizational workflows and safety management concepts, foundational math concepts (calculations, graphs, statistics), and ability to solve basic equations and visualize data",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",

    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Workplace safety procedure training for professionals, focusing on applying mathematical analysis (probability, statistics, problem-solving)—such as risk prediction modeling and efficiency analysis—in real work contexts. Emphasizes data-driven decision-making and algorithmic thinking.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Explain the impact of organizational culture awareness on acquiring knowledge necessary for mathematical problem-solving (e.g., equation modeling, optimization problems).",
    "Enhance the ability to apply new mathematical formulas (e.g., regression analysis, matrix operations) and algorithms (e.g., optimization algorithms) through strengthened self-efficacy.",
    "Learners apply at least three statistical analysis methods (mean, standard deviation, correlation) to safety and security procedure-related knowledge (e.g., accident rates, risk factor data), identify strengths of analysis results (e.g., data distribution characteristics, variable relationships), and explain them in a 500-character report.",
    "Learners analyze cases where three learning motivation strategies (e.g., gamification, goal-setting, feedback systems) were applied during a one-week corporate intensive course, and explain the impact of each strategy on mathematical knowledge integration (e.g., graph interpretation, probability modeling) using three or more of five evaluation criteria (engagement, comprehension, applicability, sustainability, effectiveness)."
