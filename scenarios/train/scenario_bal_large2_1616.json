  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic proficiency in digital tools, experience in elementary mathematics instruction, foundational skills in interpreting formulas and graphs, and introductory statistical data analysis",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A competency enhancement program for elementary mathematics educators in corporate settings, focusing on simultaneously developing mathematical thinking skills (calculation, proof, problem-solving) and digital tool integration capabilities. Particularly emphasizes strengthening instructional design competencies for function relationship analysis and probabilistic thinking.",
    "institution_type": "Corporate/Enterprise",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Enhance the ability to design math lessons reflecting 21st-century core competencies (critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, etc.) and develop equation modeling and graph analysis strategies for complex problem-solving processes.",
    "Using mobile-optimized instructional design tools (Google Forms, Microsoft Forms, etc.), learners create one structured survey and two digital worksheets (including function graphing and probability distribution calculation problems) to measure math concepts. After testing on mobile devices, they achieve ≥90% functional completeness.",
    "Explain methods for developing and applying digital rubrics for learner-customized assessments and design analytical evaluation criteria (calculation accuracy, logical development, graph interpretation skills, etc.) for math problem-solving processes."
