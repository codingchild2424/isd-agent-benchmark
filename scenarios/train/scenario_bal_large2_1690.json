  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic chemistry theories and experimental methodologies, basic proficiency in digital learning tools, and foundational comprehension of interactions between science/technology and society",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Mobile-based learning for working professionals with chemistry field experience, conducted in constrained technological environments. Formative assessment-centered, with personalized feedback based on learning outcomes. Particularly emphasizes connecting chemical technologies to corporate social responsibility (CSR) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).",
    "institution_type": "Public/Non-profit educational institution",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Applying the three stages (analysis-evaluation-creation) of the GSS (General Science and Technology) framework, learners will solve three or more chemistry problems and write reports meeting four or more out of five evaluation checklist items per stage. The process will integrate scientific inquiry with social impact analysis.",
    "Using digital learning models, learners will enhance their ability to critically analyze complex chemical phenomena and strengthen their capacity to evaluate the social, economic, and environmental impacts of chemical technologies.",
    "Learners will select three types of IBL-GSS (immersive inquiry-based learning) strategies (e.g., problem-based inquiry, case analysis, simulation) and write an inquiry report applying four or more stages of the provided five-step thinking framework (analysis-reasoning-synthesis-evaluation-creation). The report must include a discussion of the ethical and social implications of chemical technologies."
