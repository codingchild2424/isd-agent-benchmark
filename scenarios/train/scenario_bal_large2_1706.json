  "title": "[Large-Scale] Plane Geometry Instructional Design Course Based on Realistic Geometry Models via Social Science Approaches: Strengthening Spatial Awareness and Resource Allocation Competencies",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Comprehensive understanding of elementary mathematics curricula and mastery of basic geometry concepts (plane figures, measurement, ratios), foundational knowledge of socio-scientific phenomena (spatial distribution, resource allocation, cultural landscapes), and recognition of the need for spatial awareness as a citizen",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Focused on preservice teachers developing applicable plane geometry learning designs for real classroom settings, this course includes historical and geographical contexts of geometry utilization (e.g., ancient civilizations’ surveying techniques, modern urban design). Curriculum design considers fostering spatial awareness as citizens (map interpretation, environmental analysis) and emphasizes connections to community issues (public space design, transportation planning).",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Using realistic geometric models, learners can analyze plane properties (area, ratio, symmetry, etc.), enhance logical reasoning considering socio-scientific variables (population distribution, land use), and cultivate problem-solving skills for social issues (urban planning, resource allocation) through spatial relationship understanding.",
    "Through project-based learning, students explain methods for calculating the area of plane figures by connecting them to real-life problems (e.g., boundary setting during land division, park placement in urban planning), fostering spatial awareness as responsible citizens.",
    "Learners analyze individual response data using formative assessment tools (Google Forms, LMS quizzes, etc.) and provide personalized feedback within 72 hours for three types (lack of conceptual understanding, insufficient application, error patterns). Based on feedback results, they propose at least three instructional design improvements (educational system, assessment framework, activity design) and secure validity of 4.0+ (5-point scale) via peer review. The process includes proposals for educational system improvements (e.g., enhanced spatial education, community integration)."
