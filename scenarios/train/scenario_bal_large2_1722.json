  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic programming comprehension (C++/Python), introductory game engine/3D graphics concepts, general understanding of disaster response protocols, and foundational knowledge of community safety systems",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Corporate job training aimed at enhancing practical open-source technology skills. Linked to curricula for community safety promotion and citizen-participatory disaster preparedness systems. Particularly emphasizes developing disaster management protocols reflecting citizen rights and local cultural characteristics.",
    "institution_type": "Corporate/Enterprise",
    "learner_age": "In their 30s",
    "learner_education": "Adult learner (non-degree)",
    "learner_role": "Office worker (administrative/management)",
    "domain_expertise": "Beginner"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners build a 3D game engine specialized for disaster management scenarios using open-source components and evaluate civic safety education effectiveness through social network analysis.",
    "Learners explain the integration process of physics engines, rendering systems, and interaction modules for virtual environment development and propose community disaster management linkage plans from a citizen-participatory protocol perspective.",
    "Learners design 2 interactive disaster simulation contents (e.g., VR scenarios, mobile apps) reflecting ≥4 of 5 corporate safety protocols, submit implementation results, and achieve ≥80/100 applicability scores from expert panels. Evaluations include compliance with civic rights protection and safety regulations."
