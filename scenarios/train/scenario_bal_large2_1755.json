    "Learners can compare two service-learning instructional models (engineering design-based and instructional design-based), identify three core features of each, and write a report presenting three or more justifications for selecting the appropriate model for two given scenarios.",
    "Learners can design an effectiveness evaluation process for three service-learning activities (e.g., community mentoring programs) using formative research methodologies (surveys, observations, focus group interviews) within one week and submit a 10-page report meeting at least four of five predefined criteria (validity, feasibility, measurability, cost-effectiveness, sustainability).",
    "Develop an assessment tool that measures seven core variables, including learner engagement, learning outcomes, and empathy.",
    "Learners can analyze reflection journals of 10 individuals within one week, propose three actionable guidelines (e.g., adjusting feedback cycles, expanding practice time) for improving instructional models, and verify if the guidelines meet at least four of five criteria in an educational effectiveness rubric."
