  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Knowledge of basic language education theories (methodology, assessment), leadership experience, and intermediate or higher proficiency in grammar and vocabulary. Additionally, requires foundational text analysis and writing skills",

    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can apply language-based communication strategies integrating grammatical, lexical, and pragmatic elements—considering cultural differences in VR environments—with 80% accuracy to improve expressive and reading skills.",
    "In constructivist collaborative tasks, learners achieve at least 15 verbal interactions (listening, speaking, feedback) per week among peers, aiming to improve writing skills through peer evaluation feedback.",
    "Language leadership strategies meeting project-based assessment criteria (text analysis, expressiveness, critical thinking) in digital simulation environments are developed to strengthen communication skills in multicultural contexts."
