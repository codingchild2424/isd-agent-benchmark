  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "JLPT N3 or higher proficiency in Japanese, basic understanding of translation theory, and general knowledge of Japanese sociocultural context and political/economic systems",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A collaborative learning environment emphasizing translation practice and feedback processes through real video game translation project simulations. Focuses on translation considering cultural elements within games (e.g., regional characteristics, historical backgrounds) and social relationships (character hierarchy, expression of citizens' rights). Cultivates the ability to handle game content reflecting economic and political contexts (e.g., virtual currency systems, political allegories).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Apply three or more translation strategies considering the cultural context and social relationships (hierarchy, regional characteristics) of Japanese video game dialogues (text) and UI elements.",
    "Learners can produce three translation outputs reflecting Japanese cultural expressions (honorifics, idioms ≥5) and game constraints (≤15 characters, ±0.5-second voice sync tolerance). They can achieve ≥4 out of 5 on a peer evaluation rubric (accuracy, cultural appropriateness, technical suitability).",
    "Through iterative translation based on peer and instructor feedback, learners can achieve ≥80% final translation quality and validate cultural appropriateness (considering historical context, civil rights expressions, etc.)."
