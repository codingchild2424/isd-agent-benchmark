    "Graduate students will collaborate in multidisciplinary teams (four members) on three problem-based learning (PBL) scenarios (e.g., climate change response, medical AI development, sustainable energy design) over three weeks. They will write two weekly meeting logs (summaries, role assignments, decisions) and submit a 15-minute PPT with 5-minute Q&A that meets at least four of five rubric criteria (clarity, logic, creativity, teamwork, visual effectiveness)."
