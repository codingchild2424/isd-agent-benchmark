  "title": "Development of a TPACK-based technology-integrated language instructional design module for geometry classes: Enhancing terminology, logic, and interaction",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic geometric concepts and related linguistic expressions (technical terminology, logical narrative structures), secondary education experience, digital device proficiency, and foundational language instruction design skills",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A module development course for corporate educators to improve geometry instruction through technology integration. Includes ADDIE model-based module design and field application evaluation. Emphasizes technology integration strategies specialized for language education contexts (accurate terminology explanation, logical expression reinforcement, promoting linguistic interaction among learners). Particularly aims to cultivate competencies in linguistic transformation of mathematical concepts and interaction data analysis.",
    "institution_type": "Corporate/Enterprise",
    "learner_age": "In their 30s",
    "learner_education": "Middle school",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Enhancing integrated language lesson design skills through TPACK framework linkages (technology-pedagogy-content knowledge), focusing on geometric terminology, logical exposition, and learner interaction strategies.",
    "Learners create a 5-minute video or interactive resource using digital tools (e.g., GeoGebra) explaining three geometry concepts (triangle congruence, circle properties) with linguistic precision (accurate terminology, logical coherence).",
    "Learners can design technology-integrated activities using at least three digital tools (e.g., Quizlet, Padlet, Flipgrid) in corporate language training environments to achieve over 70% learner engagement (through discussions, presentations, feedback, etc.), implement them twice, and submit a structured linguistic report (introduction-body-conclusion format) with improvement plans based on engagement data."
