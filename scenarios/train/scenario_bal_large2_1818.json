  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic nursing theory and skills, foundational knowledge of elderly patient characteristics, basic understanding of scientific inquiry methods (observation, hypothesis formulation, variable control), and foundational experimental data analysis skills",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Field practice simulation education using smartphone apps as supplementary tools in limited-technology environments. Learners solve patient care problems by applying the scientific method (hypothesis→experiment→analysis→conclusion) under conditions resembling real medical settings. Emphasizes measurement tools and data interpretation skills during evidence collection/analysis.",
    "institution_type": "Graduate school",
    "learner_age": "In their 20s",
    "learner_education": "University",
    "learner_role": "Student",
    "domain_expertise": "Beginner"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will identify three or more major health issues in elderly patients (e.g., chronic diseases, fall risks, cognitive impairments) and explain evidence-based nursing strategies grounded in scientific experimental results.",
    "Learners will apply patient-centered communication skills in a simulation environment with 80% accuracy, systematically record observational data, analyze variables, and predict nursing intervention outcomes.",
    "Learners will perform leadership roles (leader/facilitator) at least once in a 4-person team-based scientific inquiry scenario (e.g., climate change response project) and apply three or more consensus-building techniques (e.g., multi-voting, Delphi method, SWOT analysis) to draft a team report.",
    "Learners will use reflective journaling after nursing simulations to create self-evaluations and improvement plans, analyze experimental results, propose evidence-based nursing approaches, and explain the conclusion-drawing process."
