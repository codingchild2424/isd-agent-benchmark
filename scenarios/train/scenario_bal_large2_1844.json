  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic chemistry theories and understanding of molecular structures, digital device proficiency, foundational skills in scientific text comprehension and writing, and experience with academic language use",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "For advanced domain experts in managerial/leadership roles. Aims to strengthen chemistry visualization competencies linked to language fields, emphasizing scientific communication and academic expressiveness. Includes advanced language learning activities: linguistic interpretation of molecular structures, academic presentation materials, peer review feedback utilization.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can develop scientific writing skills to systematically express connections between visual/verbal descriptions of molecular structure animations and physical/chemical properties",
    "Learners build accurate mental models through collaborative problem-solving with peers using molecular-level visualization tools and can explain them in language based on academic vocabulary and grammatical structures",
    "Learners interpret connections between chemical symbols, mathematical equations, and dynamic characteristics of molecular structures, and can convert them into texts with scientific argumentation structures"
