    "In blended learning environments, produce and present three or more language projects using digital tools (blogs, webquests, etc.), emphasizing text structure analysis and advanced vocabulary application",
    "Develop the ability to design integrated learning goal-assessment-activity plans based on backward design principles, considering linguistic expression diversity and grammatical system refinement",
    "Pass VR simulation-based cultural immersion and situational dialogue assessments in target language contexts, meeting listening/speaking proficiency criteria and communicative strategy standards",
    "Improve language projects twice or more based on peer feedback and formative assessment, applying iterative feedback and contextual expressions to enhance writing and reading skills"
