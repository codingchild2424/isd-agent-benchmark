    "Learners analyze two real depression case studies within 3 months, draft treatment improvement plans per a project-based assessment rubric (4 criteria: goal-setting, intervention strategies, implementation plans, evaluation methods), and share them on digital platforms (Notion/Google Docs) to receive ≥3 feedbacks from peers/experts."
