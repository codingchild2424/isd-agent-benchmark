  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic science concepts, experience in everyday problem-solving, ability to interpret scientific texts (reports, lab records), and foundational grammar and vocabulary comprehension",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Design of smartphone-based learning activities (audio/text content creation, multimedia expression), science inquiry scenarios linked to daily life (problem situations, evidence-based arguments, text structure analysis), and peer feedback activities (evaluating clarity, logical consistency, and vocabulary appropriateness).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can explain how linguistic expressions (observation records, hypothesis statements, conclusion descriptions) in the scientific inquiry process influence creative thinking and expression.",
    "Through problem-based learning (PBL), learners experience solving real-life problems via scientific and linguistic approaches (problem definition, evidence-based argument construction, text structure analysis).",
    "Learners can understand connections between scientific concepts using advanced organizers (concept maps, text structure analysis) and apply creative linguistic approaches (metaphors, explanatory writing, vocabulary expansion).",
    "Learners can select 3 stages (e.g., observation, experimental design, conclusion) from the scientific inquiry process (observation, hypothesis, experimental design, data analysis, conclusion), complete a self-assessment checklist meeting at least 7 of 10 formative criteria, and describe 2 specific improvement plans (e.g., clarifying technical terms, enhancing logical structure) within 150 characters based on results."
