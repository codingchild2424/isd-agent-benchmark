  "title": "VR-Based Urban Space Design Education: Future City Planning Considering Social Inclusivity and Environmental Sustainability",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of fundamental spatial organization principles and design elements, basic urban planning concepts (e.g., land use, transportation planning, recognition of social context considerations), and foundational knowledge of historical heritage preservation and multicultural space design",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learners access the VR platform via their personal devices (BYOD) to complete asynchronous tutorials, simulation tasks, and peer feedback activities. They analyze domestic and international urban design cases and share creative ideas based on social values in the LMS discussion board. The course particularly emphasizes case studies linked to social issues such as historical heritage preservation, multicultural space design, and citizen-participatory planning.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can complete ≥3 design projects in VR environments using 3D spatial modeling tools, reflecting social demands (publicness, citizen rights, sustainability).",
    "Learners will establish one citizen-centered spatial design plan by applying spatial cognition theories (e.g., proximity, hierarchy, landmarks) and urban planning principles (e.g., mixed-use development, pedestrian-friendly design, social inclusivity), and submit a final product that meets at least three of the five evaluation criteria (e.g., functionality, accessibility, aesthetics, social inclusivity, environmental sustainability) provided through peer review and expert feedback.",
    "Through peer evaluation, learners will improve and optimize at least two spatial design prototypes, deriving design solutions that reflect the local community’s cultural, geographical characteristics, and historical heritage."
