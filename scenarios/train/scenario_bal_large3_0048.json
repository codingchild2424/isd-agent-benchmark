  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic statistics and understanding of infectious disease transmission models (SIR), foundational Python programming, and basic writing skills for data analysis reports along with academic vocabulary proficiency",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "This module focuses on analyzing the epidemiological impact of vaccines through data-driven modeling practice in a smartphone-based microlearning environment and expressing the findings in structured academic language (text/visualization). Special emphasis is placed on academic expression clarity, logical organization, and proper use of technical terminology to convey scientific analysis results.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "The impact of vaccination rates on infection curves can be simulated using a modified SIR model and explained through a linguistic framework that compares and contrasts analytical results",
    "Learners will build a vaccine efficacy prediction framework using country-specific vaccination data (minimum 3 countries) and a machine learning model (Random Forest or XGBoost) within one week, achieve over 75% accuracy or F1-score on test datasets, and present findings through structured academic reports and visualizations (using Matplotlib or Seaborn)",
    "Learners will interpret vaccine impact analysis results using Python-based data visualization tools (e.g., Plotly) in mobile environments and enhance linguistic proficiency to articulate findings with logical coherence and precise vocabulary in both academic and practical contexts"
