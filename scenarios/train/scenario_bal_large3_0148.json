  "title": "TPACK-Based Language-Technology Integrated Instructional Design Module Development for Geometry Instruction: Strengthening Linguistic Representation of Mathematical Concepts",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic geometric concepts, secondary education experience, digital device proficiency, foundational educational linguistics knowledge (grammar, vocabulary, discourse analysis), experience in linguistic transformation of mathematical concepts",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A module development process for integrating technology to improve geometry instruction for corporate educators. Includes ADDIE model-based module design and field application evaluation. Focuses on enhancing learners' ability to linguistically express mathematical concepts, particularly through the development of assessment tools for specialized terminology usage, analogical explanations, and integration of multiple representations (text/visual).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Enhancing instructional design capabilities linking the three core elements of the TPACK framework (Technology, Content, Pedagogy) to language learning contexts: Emphasizing linguistic metaphorization of mathematical concepts and digital tool integration strategies.",
    "Learners can use GeoGebra and similar digital tools to represent three geometry concepts (Pythagorean theorem, circle equations, trigonometric function graphs) in at least two visualization methods each, and within two weeks, develop interactive learning materials achieving 'B' (80+ points) ratings in at least four of five peer evaluation rubric criteria (clarity, accuracy, creativity, interactivity, linguistic expression). The evaluation includes consistency between text-based explanations and visual representations of mathematical concepts.",
    "Learners can design three learner-engagement activities using digital tools (Quizlet, Mentimeter, Padlet) in corporate language education settings, achieve over 80% participation (average 4.0+ on a 5-point Likert scale) in actual sessions, and create a 3-minute presentation explaining mathematical concepts (e.g., statistics, graph interpretation) through linguistic metaphors. Evaluation includes metaphorical expression, technical terminology, and discourse structure."
