    "Analyze tissue samples using the provided virtual microscope simulation and identify three basic tissue types (epithelial, connective, muscle) with 80% accuracy",
    "Over two weeks, learners will create concept maps for three weekly-provided physiological response cases (e.g., increased heart rate under stress, elevated breathing post-exercise, trembling during hypoglycemia), each incorporating at least five physiological principles (e.g., hormone secretion, nervous system responses), reflect on two peer feedbacks, and submit revised maps within seven days. Final maps must score over 80% on the rubric (accuracy 30%, logic 30%, feedback incorporation 40%)."
