  "title": "COVID-19 Critical Care Nursing Education Program: Enhancing Medical Communication and Professional Documentation Competencies",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic nursing theory and clinical practice experience, understanding of fundamental grammar and medical terminology for documentation, and structured text expression skills required for patient record-keeping",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Blended learning-based education conducted in smartphone-centric, technology-constrained environments. Targeting pre-service/in-service teachers, it reinforces language domain applications. The curriculum includes scenarios requiring language use in medical settings, such as patient record writing, symptom description, and nursing intervention instructions. Special emphasis is placed on converting symptom observations into text, utilizing professional terminology, and training clear communication expressions.",
    "institution_type": "Vocational training institution",
    "learner_age": "In their 20s",
    "learner_education": "Middle school",
    "learner_role": "Professional (medical/legal/technical)",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners explain respiratory support equipment procedures required in COVID-19 critical care management with 90% accuracy and improve their ability to systematically document patient condition changes, emphasizing structured text-based expression of symptom observations.",
    "Learners effectively write case-based care plans for critical patient symptom assessment and nursing interventions with over 80% accuracy, strengthening communication skills using specialized medical terminology and clear expressions. They apply precise vocabulary selection and grammatical structures in verbal/written descriptions of patient condition changes.",
    "Learners develop three strategies to enhance nursing process practical skills using Peergrade or Google Docs in a blended learning environment (online/offline), incorporate at least five peer feedbacks, and write a 5-page final strategy report. The report analyzes three linguistic interaction cases in the nursing process and meets at least four of five rubric criteria: clarity in symptom description, systematicity in documentation, and communication effectiveness."
