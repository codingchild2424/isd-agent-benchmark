    "Learners can optimize the visual hierarchy of mathematical formulas and the step-by-step solving methods of equations by applying cognitive load theory.",
    "According to dual coding theory, learners can design math concept explanation materials combining three types of graphs/figures (function graphs, geometric shapes, statistical charts) and two types of audio explanations (concept explanations, problem-solving solutions) and achieve an \"excellent\" rating in two or more of the three peer evaluation rubric items (clarity, integration, effectiveness).",
    "Learners can develop customized math problem-solving instructional materials (step-by-step hints, proof process visualization) considering prior knowledge levels (basic operations, algebra, geometry) and motivation (problem-solving, concept exploration)."
