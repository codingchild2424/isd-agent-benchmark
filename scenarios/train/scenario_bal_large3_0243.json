  "learning_goals": [
    "Applying mathematical instructional design frameworks (ADDIE, Dick & Carey, Kemp) in simulation/VR environments, learners will implement and design provable logical structures for at least three visualization strategies of equations, functions, and geometry concepts.",
    "Using learning design tools (GeoGebra, Desmos), learners will develop at least two formative assessment-focused instructional materials for graph interpretation (function graphs, statistical distributions) and probability distribution analysis.",
    "Enhancing competency in visualizing mathematical concepts (function graphs, 3D shapes, probability distributions) via digital devices (20% improvement in pre-post assessments) and analyzing computational efficiency.",
    "Learners will design at least three flexible teaching strategies (collaborative learning: group equation solving, flipped learning: pre-recorded lectures, personalized assignments: adjusting difficulty levels) for a medium-sized group (15–20 learners). They will achieve an 80%+ suitability score in peer and expert reviews and write a statistical analysis report for measuring learning outcomes."
