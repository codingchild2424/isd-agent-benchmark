  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic language learning experience and intermediate domain expertise (understanding grammatical structures, vocabulary application, phonological awareness, pragmatic context judgment)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A language proficiency enhancement program for current practitioners: focusing on developing practical communication skills (meetings, negotiations, customer consultations) in corporate settings. It cultivates the ability to design education integrating phonetic analysis (pronunciation, intonation, speed) and pragmatic context (formality, social relationships).",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners design audio content utilizing narrative structure and dialogic context to improve language learning outcomes (vocabulary acquisition rate, expressive fluency, phonological awareness accuracy) by over 30%.",
    "Learners analyze the transient characteristics of auditory information (pronunciation, intonation, speed) and phonological features (phonemes, syllable structure, stress patterns) to develop three types of instructional materials (listening practice audio clips, activity worksheets, assessment checklists) applying shadowing and dictation strategies within three days.",
    "Learners create a 5-minute audio scenario integrating at least three environmental sound elements (e.g., office conversations, factory machinery noises, customer service interactions) in a corporate language education context and produce an evaluation report receiving scores of 4 or higher (on a 5-point scale) in the \"learning immersion enhancement\" category from at least two out of three peer reviewers.",
    "Within two weeks, learners design a 5-item rubric assessing auditory attention (background noise filtering) and semantic differentiation (intonation/stress analysis), using it to measure peer learners' pronunciation accuracy (over 90%) and listening comprehension (over 80%). They also demonstrate the ability to provide feedback reflecting pragmatic context (formality levels, social relationships)."
