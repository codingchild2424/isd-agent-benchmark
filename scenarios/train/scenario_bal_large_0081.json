  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational product design theory and practical experience, understanding of basic mathematical concepts (geometry, algebra, statistics, probability), and equation-solving/graph interpretation skills",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A practice-oriented short-term course for current professionals, intensively covering core elements of math education tool design (computational models, spatial organization, assessment methods) in online environments. Particularly emphasizes design approaches considering both mathematical accuracy (equations, statistical significance) and pedagogical effectiveness, including prototype verification processes based on real-world data",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can explain core concepts (e.g., geometric structures, computational efficiency, visual representation, probability distributions, statistical modeling) at each stage of math educational tool design via real-time video interviews, including mathematical proofs and formula applications.",
    "Learners collaborate with team members using online tools to design prototypes of math educational tools and exchange measurable feedback (e.g., user test data, functionality evaluation, graph accuracy verification).",
    "Within one week, learners diagnose strengths and weaknesses of design outputs (e.g., math educational tool designs) using a formative assessment checklist (five items) and propose three or more specific improvements (e.g., formula optimization, graph visualization enhancement, probability model integration, equation-based structure reinforcement) in a proposal."
