  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Elementary language proficiency (CEFR A1-A2) and basic digital literacy. Mastery of foundational grammar systems (parts of speech, tenses, auxiliaries, etc.) and at least 1,500 essential vocabulary items, along with basic discourse structure comprehension (conversation flow, question-response patterns)",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Focuses on cultivating practical language abilities through learner interaction, conducting problem-based collaborative activities in online/offline environments. Particularly strengthens communication strategies through integrated listening, speaking, reading, and writing activities, and develops self-directed learning abilities through feedback incorporation processes. Focuses on vocabulary expansion (academic terms, situational expressions), grammatical accuracy improvement (complex sentence usage), and pragmatic competence enhancement (contextual appropriateness) during the learning process",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners analyze real-world language use cases to design and apply context-appropriate communication strategies considering discourse context and pragmatic elements (contextual implicature, speech acts, social relationships).",
    "In teams of 4–5, learners complete three or more collaborative problem-solving activities (topics: academic/social issues) and submit a 10-minute presentation or 15-minute negotiation dialogue task. They achieve over 80% on the rubric (content organization 30%, linguistic accuracy 30%, collaboration efficiency 40%) with fewer than five grammar errors and over ten proper nouns/academic terms. They demonstrate CEFR B1-level linguistic performance (85% grammatical accuracy, 15+ vocabulary diversity) and utilize over 2,000 high-frequency core vocabulary items with appropriate discourse markers.",
    "Using digital tools like Padlet and Google Sites, learners systematically organize ten or more language learning outputs (3 essays, 3 recordings, 4 project reports) into a portfolio. They submit a one-page report specifying improvements reflecting three or more peer/instructor feedback sessions. Outputs include text analysis (80%+ grammar/vocabulary accuracy), writing (500+ words, 30%+ complex sentence structures), and speaking expression evaluation (meeting pronunciation/fluency criteria)."
