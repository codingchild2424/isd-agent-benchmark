  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Secondary-level mathematics curriculum knowledge (algebra, geometry, statistics, probability), online learning experience, basic assessment design competencies (rubric development, item creation), foundational understanding of mathematical proofs",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Enhancing assessment tool development skills for current secondary math teachers and educators, applicable to actual classroom settings. Focuses on verifying calculation accuracy, evaluating graph interpretation skills, and analyzing multi-step problem-solving processes. Requires developing assessment materials contextualized to real exam questions for enhanced practical applicability.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Design three or more assessment items analyzing mathematical problem-solving (equations, inequalities, functions) and proof processes that reflect Freirean evaluation principles (dialogicity, reflexivity, co-intentionality).",
    "Educational administrators establish a process to operate a mobile device-based student blog assessment system: (1) draft an evaluation procedure document (criteria, frequency, methods) within three days; (2) collect blog activity data (comments, views, posting frequency) and generate monthly visualization reports (bar/ pie/line graphs); (3) provide personalized feedback (strengths/improvements in computational accuracy, graph interpretation, etc.) to students within seven days based on statistical data (mean, standard deviation, correlations).",
    "Collaborating with two peer teachers, learners co-develop two rubrics within six months: (1) a 5-criteria rubric for mathematical written assessments (problem understanding, formula application, computational accuracy, graph interpretation, conclusion validity) and (2) a 4-criteria rubric for mathematical problem-solving processes (strategy development, reasoning, error correction, creative approaches). The rubrics receive validity verification of 4/5 or higher from an institutional expert panel.",
    "Derive ten or more formative assessment strategies to promote critical thinking, including probabilistic reasoning, multistep problem analysis, graph interpretation, proof process evaluation, variable control, and data pattern recognition."
