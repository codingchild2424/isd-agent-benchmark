  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic language learning experience (vocabulary, grammar, reading comprehension foundations) and experience with digital learning materials. Possesses fundamental writing skills and text analysis capabilities.",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "An intensive short-term program for practitioners to improve language proficiency, combining theoretical learning (cognitive science-based language acquisition principles) and practical activities (customized learning material development). It focuses on enhancing expressive, reading, and specialized text analysis skills, aiming to boost fluency through grammar pattern recognition and vocabulary network building.",
    "institution_type": "Corporate/Enterprise",
    "learner_age": "In their 30s",
    "learner_education": "University",
    "learner_role": "Office worker (administrative/management)",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can explain working memory limitations and cognitive load theory, apply them to language learning design, optimize vocabulary acquisition and grammatical structure comprehension, and strengthen reading strategies.",
    "Learners can identify three or more cognitive load factors caused by excessive visual elements (e.g., complex graphics, unnecessary colors, cluttered layouts), considering text readability, vocabulary networks, grammatical pattern clarity, and information processing efficiency.",
    "Learners can analyze formative assessment results to identify and remove three or more unnecessary visual elements from their learning materials, and submit redesigned materials emphasizing core language elements (2 grammatical patterns, 1 vocabulary network, 1 text structure) within a week."
