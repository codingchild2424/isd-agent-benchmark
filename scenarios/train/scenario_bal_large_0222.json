    "When performing online science assessment tasks (e.g., virtual lab reports), learners can establish a 3-stage self-directed learning plan using metacognitive strategies (planning-monitoring-evaluation phases) and submit weekly checklists with ≥80% completion.",
    "Using instructional support tools (3 guided prompts, feedback system, reflective journal template) in a blended environment, learners can revise three elements (question types, scoring criteria, feedback methods) of existing assessments within two weeks, include two or more specific modifications per element, and submit an improved assessment guide.",
    "Learners can analyze interaction records with peers and instructors (10 discussion posts, 5 feedbacks) and submit/present a revised proposal improving three or more items of existing assessment criteria.",
    "Learners can interpret three or more learning data points (e.g., progress rates, quiz scores, activity logs) from Google Analytics or LMS and propose two or more personalized assessment strategies (e.g., additional assignments, assessment method changes) based on individual learning patterns."
