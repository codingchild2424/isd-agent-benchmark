  "title": "[Large-Scale] Deep Learning Assessment Competency Enhancement Course in Blended Learning Environments: Social Competency and Civic Consciousness-Based Approach",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational digital literacy and elementary education field experience, basic understanding of social interaction and collaboration, and core concepts of civic consciousness (ethical decision-making, social responsibility)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Simulation/VR-based",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Acquiring methods to evaluate blended learning (online-offline) effectiveness in smartphone-centric limited technological environments. Focus on developing assessment tools for social competencies (communication, conflict resolution, cultural sensitivity), with inclusive educational design considering diverse learner backgrounds (gender, socioeconomic status, cultural differences). Integration of an assessment framework to strengthen civic consciousness (social responsibility, ethical decision-making).",
    "institution_type": "Vocational training institution",
    "learner_age": "In their 30s",

    "learner_role": "Office worker (administrative/management)",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Within a one-week short-term course, learners design three types of tools (e.g., rubrics, portfolios, project checklists) to assess higher-order thinking skills (analysis, evaluation, creativity) in blended learning environments. After applying at least two tools in actual classes via peer review and instructor feedback, they achieve 80%+ learner satisfaction. The tools include criteria for assessing social interaction, collaboration skills, and civic consciousness (ethical decision-making).",
    "Within one week, learners develop a self-assessment checklist (five items) to measure interactive learning outcomes (e.g., equipment operation accuracy, problem-solving time) in simulation/VR-based vocational training. They validate it through peer feedback (≥3 reviewers) and instructor evaluation (≥80% fulfillment), including indicators for teamwork, communication skills, and cultural sensitivity.",
    "Within one week, learners select one real-world problem from vocational settings (e.g., customer conflict resolution or process improvement) and design a project-based assessment task. Incorporating three rounds of peer feedback (two interim, one final), they write a ≤10-page final report (problem definition, solution, implementation plan) and achieve 4.0+ (5-point scale) in social relationship management (teamwork, communication) and civic consciousness (ethical decision-making, social responsibility).",
    "Within one week, learners collect and analyze in-depth learning data from 15 learners in their 30s (balanced gender, career, and field distribution) at a vocational training institute. They compare effectiveness differences by learner characteristics using ≥3 quantitative metrics (e.g., completion rate, assessment scores, satisfaction) and write a ≤500-character analysis report considering cultural diversity and socioeconomic backgrounds."
