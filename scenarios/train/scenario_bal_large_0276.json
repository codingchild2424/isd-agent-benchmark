  "title": "Strengthening Statistical Sampling and Evidence-Based Language Argumentation Competencies: Integrated Training in Data Interpretation and Linguistic Expression",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic statistical concepts, job-related data analysis experience, ability to draft basic business documents and structure reports, and proficiency in using profession-specific vocabulary within workplace contexts",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Collaborative learning environment focusing on constructing persuasive arguments using statistical evidence in workplace contexts. Emphasizes training to translate data interpretations into linguistic expressions (text/writing) and improving argument structuring through peer review (evaluating expressiveness, logic, persuasiveness). Learners master optimizing vocabulary and sentence structures for diverse job scenarios.",
    "institution_type": "Corporate/Enterprise",
    "learner_age": "In their 30s",
    "learner_education": "High school",
    "learner_role": "Office worker (administrative/management)",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Develop the ability to construct data-driven arguments by applying sampling methods based on real-world job scenarios and express them in text with linguistic clarity and logical coherence.",
    "Enhance the ability to evaluate the validity of evidence-based arguments from diverse perspectives through collaborative learning with peers and provide feedback with logical consistency and linguistic persuasiveness.",
    "Learners assess their ability to structure arguments using statistical concepts through formative assessments (2 questions each on statistical data interpretation, hypothesis testing, and result visualization) provided every two weeks, achieve over 80% accuracy in two consecutive evaluations after feedback incorporation, and write evaluation results in a linguistic report (introduction-body-conclusion structure)."
