  "title": "[Large-scale] Transformative and Transcendent Language Learning Design Course for Net Generation Practitioners: Enhancing Text Analysis, Discourse Construction, and Digital Collaboration Skills",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic language proficiency (reading, writing, speaking, listening), practical experience, understanding of basic grammar and document drafting skills, experience with digital collaboration tools, and foundational vocabulary in specialized fields",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A blended learning environment combining smartphone-based collaborative tools (real-time text editing, voice feedback) with offline activities (role-playing, presentation sessions, peer reviews). Focus is placed on improving learners' expressive accuracy (grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation) and communicative fluency (discourse organization, contextual understanding, response speed). Comprehensive language proficiency is measured at the course's conclusion through portfolio assessments (text samples, recordings, journals).",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Through project execution, learners will improve practical language skills (specialized vocabulary, context analysis, discourse organization) by ≥30%, with particular emphasis on text structuring and expression accuracy in business documents and digital communication.",
    "In digital tool-based collaborative projects, learners will apply self-directed problem-solving strategies (e.g., text restructuring, grammar correction, pronunciation refinement, vocabulary diversification) ≥2 times, and enhance communication fluency using peer feedback and real-time voice correction features.",
    "Learners will write biweekly reflective journals identifying ≥2 improvement areas in their language learning process (pronunciation, vocabulary acquisition, grammar application, text comprehension, discourse organization), develop ≥1 actionable improvement plan, and submit a report meeting ≥2 of 3 trainer feedback checklist criteria (clarity, specificity, feasibility)."
