  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic language learning skills (grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, writing), foundational understanding of collaborative learning, experience with digital resources, and elementary grasp of linguistic concepts",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Operating a project-based collaborative learning environment for job-seeking learners to strengthen language competencies. It includes small-group activities using digital resources (language analysis tools, collaboration platforms) in a BYOD environment. Learners are evaluated on writing skills, critical thinking, text analysis, and communication strategies. Social linguistics perspectives are reinforced through language policy analysis in multicultural contexts.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners improve time management skills for language learning and text analysis proficiency by over 20% through small-group learning strategies.",
    "Based on structured feedback, learners generate at least three conflict-resolution strategies arising during collaboration and apply communicative expression strategies (grammatical accuracy, lexical diversity, pragmatic appropriateness).",
    "Through pre- and post-surveys, learners shift perceptions of small-group language learning to over 70% positive, reflecting changes in learning motivation.",
    "Within one week, learners write a 5-page report integrating three linguistic theories for a given project topic (e.g., analyzing language policies in multicultural societies) and achieve scores of 4 or higher (on a 5-point scale) in peer and instructor evaluation criteria (creativity, theoretical applicability, practicality, text analysis skills), demonstrating linguistic knowledge integration and critical application."
