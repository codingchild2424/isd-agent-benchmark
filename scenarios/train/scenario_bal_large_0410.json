  "learning_goals": [
    "An online course design framework aligned with QM standards and national language education standards (KSL) can be applied to build an integrated learning environment for reading, writing, and speaking.",
    "Design at least three multimodal interaction strategies (e.g., discussions, role-playing, feedback activities) to promote learner engagement, incorporating communication strategies and vocabulary expansion elements.",
    "Learners can develop one language learning content piece (video or document) within a week that reflects at least three criteria each for cultural inclusivity (including multicultural expressions and idioms) and accessibility (captions and audio descriptions for visual/hearing impairments), and submit a final product meeting at least four out of five peer evaluation rubric items.",
    "Submit project outcomes that demonstrate clear alignment between learning objectives, assessments, and rubrics, incorporating language proficiency evaluation criteria (grammar, vocabulary, communication, expression) and cultural context."
