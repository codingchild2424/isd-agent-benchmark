    "Students generate at least three hypotheses about a given scientific phenomenon (e.g., light refraction, plant photosynthesis) and apply logical analysis skills to write a report through a verification process meeting four or more of the five experimental design checklist items.",
    "Students use digital collaboration tools (Padlet/Google Docs) to receive feedback from three or more peers, then write a 500+ character argumentative essay that clearly includes the scientific argumentation structure (problem definition, hypothesis, evidence, conclusion).",
    "Over two weeks, students propose three solutions per scenario from three provided PBL scenarios (e.g., climate change response, water pollution analysis) and demonstrate critical decision-making processes achieving 10+ points out of 15 based on the teacher’s evaluation rubric (problem recognition, evidence presentation, alternative comparison)."
