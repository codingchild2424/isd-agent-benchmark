    "Within six months, learners develop learner-level (beginner/intermediate/advanced) customized feedback algorithms (calculation error pattern analysis, graph interpretation support, proof process reinforcement) by analyzing formative assessment data (300+ learners), verifying 20% improvement in feedback satisfaction (3.5→4.2 on 5-point scale) via A/B testing compared to existing systems"
