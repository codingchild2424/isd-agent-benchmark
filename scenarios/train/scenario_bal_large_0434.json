  "title": "[Large-Scale] Online Intercultural Language Education Design: Practical Expression and Reading Comprehension Enhancement Through Interpretive Approaches",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic language proficiency (grammar/vocabulary comprehension and elementary writing skills), intercultural communication experience, foundational digital text analysis, and reading experience with diverse genres (explanatory texts, dialogues)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course focused on analyzing and practicing text structures in intercultural communication scenarios within offline classroom settings using digital devices. Emphasis is placed on enhancing cultural contextual understanding through learners' application of writing skills (expression across genres) and reading comprehension strategies (contextual inference, critical reading).",

    "learner_education": "University",
    "learner_role": "Office worker (administrative/management)",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners analyze linguistic and non-linguistic texts (e.g., mask-wearing practices) from an interpretive perspective in real cross-cultural contexts, comparing cultural expression methods and reading strategies",
    "Learners mediate peers’ cultural interpretations during classroom interactions, demonstrate adjustment techniques considering grammatical/vocabulary differences, and apply contextually appropriate language expressions (e.g., politeness levels)",
    "Learners develop two or more integrated reading-writing activity modules reflecting interpretive approaches in the instructional design phase, incorporating writing strategies according to text types (expository/persuasive texts)"
