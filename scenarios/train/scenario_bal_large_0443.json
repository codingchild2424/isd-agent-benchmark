  "title": "[Large-Scale] STEM Instructional Design Evaluation Process Based on Information Flow: Socioscientific Approach and Civic Competency Enhancement",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic STEM education design concepts, project-based learning (PBL) experience, foundational understanding of sociostructural factors (e.g., class, culture, institutions), and basic digital literacy",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A Course Focused on Acquiring Quantifiable Evaluation Methods Applicable to Practical Settings. Parallel collaboration and individual learning in a BYOD environment. Particularly emphasizing the development of evaluation systems that consider the social impact of instructional design (e.g., digital divide, formation of learning communities, expansion of civic engagement). Includes case studies of instructional design for solving local community issues",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Explain objective evaluation methods for STEM instructional design using an information flow analysis framework from a socio-institutional perspective, analyzing how educational policies impact citizen rights assurance.",
    "In real-case projects, apply information flow mapping tools to identify ≥3 design flaws (e.g., knowledge gaps, resource allocation imbalance, cultural bias) and propose social relationship improvement strategies.",
    "Propose instructional design improvements through peer/self-evaluation using quantitative metrics (e.g., engagement, resource utilization, social equity index) and assess feasibility considering institutional constraints of educational organizations.",
    "In a BYOD environment, learners will create one type of visualization (e.g., flowchart, Gantt chart) using Google Workspace (Docs, Sheets, Slides) to map team project information flow, achieving ≥80% completion rate based on peer reviews and instructor feedback. The process will analyze learner interactions and social learning effects (e.g., collaborative network formation, digital citizenship development)."
