  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic accounting concepts, fundamental mathematical skills, and understanding of scientific problem-solving approaches (hypothesis formulation, variable control)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A short-term intensive course conducted in smartphone-centric limited-technology environments. Learners reconstruct daily-life cases into math-based accounting materials according to scientific experimental design principles (variable control, repeated measurement). Focuses on observable data collection and evidence-based conclusion drawing. Utilizes mobile experimental tools (calculators, data collection apps)",

    "Learners will solve accounting problems with 80% or higher accuracy based on mathematical measurements and scientific analysis in mobile environments.",
    "Within one week, learners will decompose three core accounting concepts (e.g., cost calculation, financial statement analysis, tax planning) into at least two variables (e.g., time/cost, risk/return) using the scientific inquiry method (observation-hypothesis-experiment-analysis), and submit the decomposition results via a 5-level rubric (clarity, logic, applicability, creativity, practicality) with scaffolding strategies (concept mapping, case comparison, expert feedback).",
    "Learners will achieve an average score of 75 or higher in a summative assessment within one week, demonstrating improved accounting learning outcomes with quantitative evidence (data analysis results, experiment reports)."
