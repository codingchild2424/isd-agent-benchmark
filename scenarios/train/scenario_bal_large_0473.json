    "Learners must identify three types of blended learning preferences (e.g., blended-preference, flexibility-seeking) among corporate learners aged ≥40, design customized support systems (learning materials, feedback frequency, tech tools) for each type within one week, and submit an implementation plan meeting ≥4 of 5 checklist items.",
