  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will explain core concepts of dissolved oxygen (DO) control in wastewater treatment processes and analyze their importance in terms of water quality management and environmental regulation compliance.",
    "Learners will understand the principles of applying fuzzy logic and online Q-learning-based intelligent control methods, and develop strategies to maximize energy efficiency and process stability.",
    "Learners can analyze three DO concentration tracking control simulation cases within a week and produce a report meeting at least two control performance evaluation criteria (error rate within ±5%, response time under 10 seconds). Additionally, they can propose environmental impact assessments and improvement plans based on analysis results."
