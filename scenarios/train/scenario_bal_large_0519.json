    "Applying the four-stage RME (Realistic Mathematics Education) process (presenting real-life contexts → exploring informal strategies → refining mathematical representations → formalization), learners develop a one-week module solving ≥3 daily math problems (e.g., budget allocation, statistical interpretation, ratio calculations) and submit demonstration materials meeting ≥4 out of 5 peer rubric criteria (e.g., realism, mathematical refinement, applicability).",
    "Using LSLC learning community practices (e.g., regular feedback sessions, collaborative lesson design workshops), learners collaborate with two peer teachers to derive ≥1 lesson improvement plan and achieve ≥20% satisfaction enhancement in pre-post lesson effectiveness evaluations.",
    "In a one-week RME course, learners use multi-tiered assessments (two formative quizzes, one summative project report) to achieve ≥80% mastery in ≥4 out of 5 rubric criteria."
