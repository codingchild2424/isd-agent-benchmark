    "Learners can simulate gene expression mechanisms (promoter, transcription, translation) using digital modeling tools (e.g., CellDesigner, COPASI) and write reports explaining the gene-editing principles of the CRISPR-Cas9 system linked to three or more real-world applications (e.g., gene therapy, crop improvement)."
