    "Learners integrate SoTL methodologies with community problem-solving cases to develop field-oriented educational modules, including collaborative learning strategies reflecting political and cultural contexts",
    "Learners design and implement a 2-week engagement-enhancement program (real-time feedback, gamification, collaborative learning) in a blended environment (online+offline) for 50 learners in their 30s at public educational institutions. The program must achieve ≥20% improvement in engagement scores in pre-post surveys, submit a learner rights awareness evaluation (≥7/10 scale) and institutional improvement proposals (≥3 concrete suggestions), while incorporating cultural diversity and civic collaboration systems",
    "Learners propose an evaluation system to measure public administration education effectiveness, including indicators reflecting cultural and political contexts. The system must include social impact metrics such as citizen participation, rights awareness changes, and feasibility of institutional improvement proposals"
