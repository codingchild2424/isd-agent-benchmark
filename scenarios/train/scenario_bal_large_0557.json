  "title": "[Large-Scale] Multimodal Teaching Method Design Using Video for Developing Elementary Mathematics and Language Integrated Learning Media",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic arithmetic operation skills, understanding of geometric concepts, recognition of fundamental grammatical structures (subject-predicate relationships, tense usage), and simple text comprehension abilities (contextual inference, keyword extraction)",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Focuses on developing video-based learning media implementable in smartphone-centric limited-technology environments, specializing in multimodal content design that integrates math concept explanations and language learning (vocabulary, grammar, reading comprehension). Includes synchronized subtitles (keyword highlighting) and voice explanations (sentence structure analysis) to improve reading comprehension. Adds interactive quizzes (fill-in-the-blank, sentence reconstruction) within videos to enhance language learning.",
    "institution_type": "Vocational training institution",

    "learner_role": "Office worker (administrative/management)",
    "domain_expertise": "Beginner"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Using instructional videos, learners can explain geometric properties and surface area calculation principles of rectangular prisms, cubes, prisms, and pyramids using mathematical terminology (area, volume, formulas) and integrate this with language learning (acquisition of technical terms).",
    "Following video tutorials, learners can reproduce step-by-step problem-solving processes through visual and linguistic expressions (diagramming, writing explanatory texts) and summarize core concepts into structured sentences (using topic sentences and connectors).",
    "Using mobile learning platforms, learners can set specific 4-week learning goals (e.g., mastering 50 math terms + 5 grammar items), achieve an 80%+ implementation rate according to weekly plans, and write reflective learning journals (grammar error analysis, vocabulary usage evaluation) using provided language learning media (text/audio/video)."
