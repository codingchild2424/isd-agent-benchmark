    "By the end of the six-month course, learners explain preventive medicine knowledge (dietary control, exercise prescription, medication management) for managing patients’ LDL cholesterol levels with ≥80% accuracy and apply counseling skills (empathic listening, motivational interviewing) to three standardized patient scenarios, producing reports meeting ≥3.0/4.0-scale evaluation criteria.",
    "During three or more workshop practicums in the six-month course, learners perform behavior-change scenarios using motivational interviewing techniques (Open-ended questions, Affirmations, Reflective listening, Summarizations) with standardized patients (SPs), achieving ≥4/5-point scale in peer feedback and developing improvement plans.",
    "Over six months, learners analyze ten real clinical cases (chronic disease management, vaccinations, health screenings) to identify three or more barriers (e.g., patient unawareness, resource limitations, systemic issues) in preventive medicine implementation, and propose one or more actionable solutions (communication guidelines, resource allocation plans, policy proposals) per barrier."
