    "Learners can write UML class diagrams and sequence diagrams according to a given business scenario to clearly express system requirements.",
    "Learners can collaboratively solve software design problems through PBL team activities (3-4 members) and present results via pitching sessions.",
    "Learners can analyze modeling error cases (e.g., missing dependencies, excessive coupling) from actual industry settings and suggest improvements in summative assessments."
