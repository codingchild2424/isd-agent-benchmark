  "learning_goals": [
    "Apply the four models of Courseware Engineering Methodology (CEM)—instructional, conceptual, interface, and hypermedia—to design science experiment modules and strengthen variable control capabilities—identifying and controlling independent/dependent variables during experimental design.",
    "Acquire practical skills in an integrated modeling approach for developing mobile-friendly microlearning content—systematically integrating the scientific hypothesis verification process (observation→hypothesis→experiment→analysis→conclusion).",
    "Develop interactive courseware through project-based assessment, achieving 80%+ learner engagement—including experimental data analysis and evidence-based conclusion activities (utilizing data visualization and statistical analysis tools)."
