  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic understanding of online learning environments and self-regulated learning, along with foundational knowledge of social learning theory (social interaction, peer learning, cultural/institutional influences)",

    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Development and validation of survey-based assessment tools tailored for professional groups (medical/legal/technical). Designed considering social contexts (citizenship, rights, institutions) such as workplace learning culture, peer knowledge sharing, and organizational learning support systems.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Development of a valid online self-regulated learning measurement survey tool and validation of its applicability in social learning contexts (social interaction, peer learning)",
    "Analysis of social variables’ (culture, institutions, relationships) influence through measurement equivalence verification across groups (gender, network environment, occupational background)",
    "Learners use the MSLQ-based self-regulated learning questionnaire to analyze their learning characteristics (motivation, cognition, behavior domains), establish ≥3 personalized learning strategies (e.g., time management, goal-setting, feedback utilization) based on results, and create an 8-week implementation plan. They may include collaborative strategies (knowledge sharing, role division, peer assessment) with fellow learners"
