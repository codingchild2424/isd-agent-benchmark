    "Within one week, learners can analyze the impact of data scientists' subjectivity on AI model design through three case studies (e.g., data selection bias, feature engineering decisions, evaluation metric setting) and document their findings in a 5-page APA-formatted report (excluding references).",
    "Identify at least three social factors to consider when designing a machine learning system tailored to a specific sociocultural context (language processing).",
    "Within a one-week intensive course, learners can visualize model explainability (using LIME or SHAP) for a given project dataset, propose at least three bias detection and mitigation strategies, and achieve over 80% satisfaction in peer reviews and instructor feedback."
