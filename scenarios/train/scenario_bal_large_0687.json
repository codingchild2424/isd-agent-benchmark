    "In a 3-member project team, learners can perform the process of collecting, processing, and interpreting math-based data (minimum 10 samples) and submit deliverables for each stage of the experiential learning cycle (data collection report, processing documentation, interpretation conclusion, application case presentation materials), meeting at least four out of five evaluation criteria.",
    "During the 4-week mid-term course, learners can record their mathematical thinking process at least three times in a personal learning portfolio and demonstrate peer-evaluated cases where they applied at least two problem-solving strategies, achieving an average score of 3.5 or higher on a 5-point rubric."
