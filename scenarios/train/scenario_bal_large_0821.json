  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic calculus concepts, foundational linear algebra knowledge, ability to interpret mathematical formulas and graphs, and foundational skills in translating mathematical concepts into linguistic expressions",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Conducting blended learning combining mobile apps and LMS in a BYOD environment. It strengthens real-world problem-solving skills through project-based assessments. Learners receive peer feedback and instructor evaluations to improve mathematical expression and logical writing skills, while simultaneously training to clearly convey mathematical concepts through linguistic expression.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Accurately compute partial derivatives, multiple integrals, and line integrals of multivariable functions, and solve physics problems by linguistically expressing mathematical expressions and graphs.",
    "Demonstrate the ability to solve physics problems using vector field concepts, Stokes’ Theorem, and the Divergence Theorem, and clearly describe proof processes with logical expressions and mathematical terminology.",
    "Learners can analyze ≥3 learning materials (videos, papers, case studies) in blended learning environments, write a 500-word summary report meeting ≥3 of 5 rubric items, collaborate in real-time ≥2 times with team members using digital tools (Google Docs/Zoom Breakout Rooms), and submit a final team project meeting ≥4 of 5 rubric items (creativity, analytical depth, collaboration efficiency, visual expression, practicality). Additionally, document mathematical modeling processes using LaTeX or Excel equation editors and supplement mathematical expressions with linguistic descriptions."
