  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic medical knowledge, educational administration experience, understanding of social relationships and institutional environments within healthcare organizations (hierarchical decision-making, multidisciplinary team operations), and foundational concepts related to patient rights and medical ethics",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "eLearning module design and evaluation training for healthcare administrators/leaders. Conducted in smartphone-centric environments, it requires content tailored to medical professionals' workflows (hierarchical reporting, interdisciplinary collaboration needs) and organizational culture. Prioritizes socio-contextual learning experiences (patient rights, medical ethics, interdisciplinary teamwork) with integrated approaches to cultural sensitivity (diverse patient backgrounds) and institutional constraints (privacy compliance).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Applying the eLearning module development standard process (analysis-design-development-evaluation), learners can establish a medical education content production plan reflecting healthcare workers' social and professional needs (patient rights, medical ethics, cultural sensitivity, etc.).",
    "Based on needs analysis of healthcare workers over 40, learners can design ten usability evaluation metrics for medical eLearning modules (e.g., compliance with medical protocols, clarity of patient safety content, cultural sensitivity, inclusion of interdisciplinary collaboration cases), have eight or more validated by experts, and submit a final report.",
    "Learners can develop three self-directed eLearning strategies (modular learning, situational simulation, feedback-based iterative learning) implementable in limited technological environments (basic PC/mobile devices), propose two execution plans (gradual authority delegation, cross-functional workshops) considering institutional constraints (privacy regulations, hierarchical decision-making) and organizational culture (hierarchical communication, multidisciplinary team operations), and evaluate these plans using a five-step checklist (goal alignment, feasibility, resource efficiency, cultural fit, sustainability).",
    "Learners can demonstrate the effectiveness of three PBL-based e-learning modules within a company over six months through quantitative evaluation (completion rate ≥80%, average quiz score ≥75/100) and qualitative evaluation (participant satisfaction survey ≥4.0/5.0, collection of ≥3 open-ended feedbacks). The evaluation considers institutional changes in healthcare organizations (policy improvements, protocol updates) and learning transfer effects (field application cases, improved patient outcomes)."
