    "They derive at least three learner motivation factors when designing virtual lab-based projects.",
    "Learners develop ≥3 measurement indicators (e.g., number of idea proposals, completeness of material preparation, collaborative attitude) to evaluate individual contributions in a 4-member team project, create an assessment checklist applying these indicators, and obtain agreement from ≥80% of team members.",
    "Over 80% of learners achieve the ability to apply engineering theory knowledge to virtual lab projects."
