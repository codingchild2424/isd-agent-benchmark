  "title": "[Large-Scale] Language Education Design for Building a Sustainable E-Learning Ecosystem: Strengthening Text, Vocabulary, and Communication Skills with Integrated Scientific Inquiry Methods",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic language learning experience (grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension), online learning platform usage experience, digital collaboration tool proficiency, foundational understanding of the scientific inquiry process (observation-hypothesis-experiment-analysis)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learner Role: Students/Job Seekers; Domain Expertise: Intermediate (Language Instruction Design & Digital Literacy); Technical Environment: Digital Devices Provided; Assessment Method: Project-Based Evaluation (Integrated Writing, Presentation, & Feedback Assessment). This scenario employs an innovative approach combining language learning with digital literacy, evaluating learning outcomes through concrete metrics such as text analysis, vocabulary expansion, and communication effectiveness measurement.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will analyze the three core components of an e-learning ecosystem framework (pedagogy, content, system) and apply the scientific inquiry method (hypothesis-formulation, experimentation, analysis, conclusion) to language learning content design, optimizing text-based learning effectiveness.",
    "Learners will plan and execute language learning projects using a learning management system (LMS), apply integrated reading-writing-speaking strategies in digital environments, and enhance communication skills through peer feedback.",
    "Within four weeks, learners will collaborate with three peers to design one sustainable digital learning resource (learning object), upload it to a shared platform (Google Drive, GitHub, etc.), and achieve \"excellent\" ratings in four or more of the five peer evaluation rubric items (grammar accuracy, vocabulary diversity, text structure, communication effectiveness, creativity). Learning outcomes will be validated through evidence-based analysis (peer review)."
