  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of core scientific concepts (experimental design, hypothesis formulation, variable classification) and ability to use basic measurement tools (thermometers, pH meters, etc.), along with foundational knowledge of the scientific inquiry process (observation → hypothesis → experiment → conclusion)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Working professionals acquire science knowledge (e.g., industrial data analysis, environmental monitoring) and improve problem-solving skills (experimental design→data collection→analysis→conclusion). Emphasizes systematic application of the scientific inquiry process (observation→hypothesis→experiment→conclusion) and evidence-based decision-making. Includes digital tools enabling lab-level inquiry in remote settings.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners must enhance cognitive engagement in scientific inquiry by ≥30% using task-structuring strategies (e.g., independent/dependent variable control experiments) in remote settings and systematically analyze observational data.",
    "In face-to-face sessions, learners must apply scientific concepts to real-world cases (e.g., climate change modeling) through collaborative problem-solving activities (e.g., peer-reviewed hypothesis validation and data analysis) and derive evidence-based conclusions.",
    "Learners periodically diagnose their cognitive engagement levels through formative assessments (e.g., lab report feedback and peer evaluation) and develop evidence-based improvement plans based on analytical results."
