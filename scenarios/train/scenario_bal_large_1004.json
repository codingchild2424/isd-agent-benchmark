    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Language education curriculum conducted in smartphone-centric limited-technology environments. Features asynchronous activities (writing feedback, reading discussions) and evidence-based summative assessments via LMS, focusing on improving expressive and reading skills. Emphasizes cultivating contextual language use through diverse text types (expository, argumentative, narrative).",

    "Explain systematic design methods for learning activity variables (grammatical structures, lexical networks, contextual elements) based on language acquisition theories (e.g., input hypothesis, output hypothesis) using scientific inquiry approaches",
    "Apply a process for evaluating/improving learning design elements (grammatical structures, lexical choices, communicative effectiveness) through peer feedback and evidence-based analysis",
    "Analyze three cases of integrated reading-writing activities within LMS platforms (e.g., Google Classroom, Moodle), submit inquiry result reports incorporating peer evaluation/feedback within two weeks"
