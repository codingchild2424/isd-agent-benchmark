    "Design a system classifying traffic accident severity (casualty/property damage) into three levels using a multi-task deep learning model",
    "Using the Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) technique, learners can visualize prediction results of a CNN-based image classification model (e.g., ResNet-50) in three or more formats (heatmaps, superpixels, segmentation) and compare the interpretive insights provided by each method in approximately 500 words.",
    "Learners will apply three preprocessing techniques—(1) handling missing values (mean/median imputation or deletion), (2) Min-Max normalization or Z-Score standardization, (3) PCA or domain-based feature extraction—to a given CSV/JSON dataset using Python, build a binary classification/regression model with Scikit-learn’s RandomForest or TensorFlow’s DNN, evaluate performance using three metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC), and document the results (code + analysis) in a Jupyter Notebook shared on GitHub."
