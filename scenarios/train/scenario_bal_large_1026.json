  "title": "[Large-scale] Project-Based Mathematics Education Design for HRD Professional Competency Development: Data Analysis and Decision-Making Modeling",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Elementary mathematics knowledge (algebra, geometry, statistics) and HRD fundamentals, data interpretation skills: particularly equation solving, graph analysis, and probability calculation experience",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Aims to strengthen HRD competencies specialized in the mathematics domain (calculation, analysis, modeling), supporting learners in developing educational design skills (problem-solving, decision-support system construction) applicable in real corporate environments. The curriculum focuses on mathematical proofs and data-driven decision-making processes.",
    "institution_type": "Corporate/Enterprise",
    "learner_age": "40s and above",
    "learner_education": "Middle school",
    "learner_role": "Office worker (administrative/management)",
    "domain_expertise": "Beginner"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Strengthening competencies to analyze HRD job requirement-derived educational technology-based math content (statistics, probability, optimization): enhancing calculation accuracy, graph interpretation, and evidence-based conclusion-drawing skills.",
    "Improving the ability to design customized math education projects (data visualization, predictive modeling) using LMS and tech tools: solving practical problems through equation-based modeling and probability distribution analysis.",
    "Corporate managers/leaders, by the end of a 4-week course, select and apply three techniques (mean, standard deviation, correlation analysis) to real business data (sales, workforce efficiency, etc.) to create a decision-making scenario. They submit a report including formula proofs, graph interpretations, and three analytical conclusions, incorporating peer evaluations (3+ reviewers) and instructor feedback (2+ rounds). The report must achieve 4+ points (out of 5) in three or more rubric categories (clarity, accuracy, practicality, creativity), with statistical significance verification."
