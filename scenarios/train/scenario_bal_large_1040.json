  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic anatomy and physiology knowledge, foundational understanding of medical ethics and patient rights, introductory communication skills for social relationship analysis",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Simulation/VR-based",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Blended learning utilizing VR simulations and online collaboration tools in a digitally supported environment. Learners simulate interactions with various stakeholders within the healthcare system (doctors, nurses, patient families, community agencies, etc.), including activities for community health promotion and cultural sensitivity development (designing civic engagement programs, establishing strategies to address health inequities).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners accurately identify neuroanatomical structures in 3D through VR simulation and explain them within social relational contexts based on scientific evidence",
    "Learners enhance clinical case analysis and medical ethical reasoning through gamified quizzes aligned with Bloom’s HOTS criteria, applying principles of patient rights respect",
    "Learners resolve complex neurological disorder cases within social relational contexts (family-medical team-community collaboration) through discussion and brainstorming with peers on collaborative platforms",
    "Learners complete three real-world clinical scenario projects (emergency response, chronic disease management, community health promotion program design) within a six-month course, achieving B grades (over 80 points) in four of five practical competency rubric categories (clinical judgment, procedural performance, teamwork, patient rights respect, community resource integration)"
