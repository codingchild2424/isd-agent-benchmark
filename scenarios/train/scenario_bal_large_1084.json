  "title": "Large-Scale ICT-Enabled Constructivist Teaching Methods Training for K-12 Science Education: Strengthening Socio-Scientific Inquiry Competency and Civic Engagement",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic science education knowledge, general experience with digital devices, understanding of the necessity of science learning in social contexts, foundational awareness of citizen science projects, and recognition of the need to consider cultural diversity",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Participants are K-12 science teacher candidates or in-service teachers who must acquire student-centered ICT-integrated teaching methods. Practical exercises using personal devices are emphasized, along with the use of online/offline collaborative tools and scientific approaches to solving community problems. Particularly, cases linking cultural diversity and citizen science projects are presented, with an emphasis on educational designs fostering learners' awareness of civic rights and social responsibilities.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can explain ≥3 science lesson design strategies based on constructivist learning theory and design inquiry processes that reflect social interaction and cultural diversity.",
    "Learners can develop ≥1 student-centered science class model using ICT tools (digital collaboration platforms, data analysis tools), incorporating collaborative problem-solving and community-linked citizen science projects.",
    "Learners can design a rubric with 5 criteria (e.g., creativity, technology utilization, collaboration level, civic engagement, cultural reflection) to evaluate student-led ICT-based science learning activities within a 2-week project period, apply it to ≥3 actual activities, propose ≥2 ways to link with citizen science projects (e.g., eBird, iNaturalist), and include community problem-solving solutions."
