  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Possession of foundational science knowledge (experimental design, observation methods, variable control), lack of information retrieval experience. Requires basic understanding of scientific methodology and data interpretation skills",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "An online course for in-service elementary teachers conducted in smartphone-centric limited-technology environments. Applies a blended learning model combining LMS-based asynchronous learning with embedded librarian education (curriculum-linked support from librarians). Designs activities integrating information literacy elements into the scientific inquiry process (observation-hypothesis-experiment-analysis-conclusion). Particularly emphasizes understanding relationships between control variables and independent/dependent variables during experiment design, and graph interpretation with statistical reasoning during data analysis.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners select reliable information sources in scientific research using three or more evaluation criteria (variable control, experimental reproducibility, data transparency) and derive evidence-based conclusions following scientific inquiry principles",
    "Using LMS-embedded tutorials (Web of Science, Scopus, etc.), learners search three or more scientific papers, create five or more APA-style references, and analyze research hypothesis-experimental design linkage matrices with over 80% accuracy. They also develop the ability to analyze statistical significance and measurement errors in experimental data",
    "Through peer evaluation and instructor feedback, learners incorporate information literacy standards (evidence-based conclusions, scientific logic verification) into project-based outputs, strengthening critical thinking in observational data pattern analysis and hypothesis verification processes"
