    "Learners can analyze formative assessment data (quiz accuracy rates below 85%, discussion participation in the bottom 20%) from online learning platforms over six months, propose three or more specific measures (e.g., content restructuring such as video segmentation and supplementary materials, interaction improvements like real-time feedback systems and discussion board redesigns), and achieve target satisfaction levels in peer evaluations (4+ on a 5-point scale) and instructor feedback (80%+ on rubric assessments)."
