  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic computational thinking concepts, early childhood education experience, knowledge of language development stages for young children (e.g., word combinations → simple sentences → complex sentences), and recognition of vocabulary level (3–5 syllable words) and grammatical structures (simple sentences)",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",

    "additional_context": "Pedagogical exploration for educators implementing computational thinking instruction for young children. Focuses on integrating language development (vocabulary expansion, sentence structure) with computational thinking (algorithms, debugging). Specifically examines linking preschoolers' linguistic expression skills (sequential explanation, conditional statements) to computational thinking activities.",

    "Design three+ non-computer-based educational activities promoting algorithmic thinking and sequential-conditional-repetitive language expressions (e.g., \"first-next-finally,\" \"if-then,\" \"repeat continuously\") in early childhood education",
    "Learners analyze three error cases from experiential activities, create debugging guides with three-step explanations (problem identification → cause explanation → solution) tailored to preschool vocabulary levels, and receive ≥4/5 points (5-point scale) in \"clarity\" and \"appropriateness\" from one of two peer evaluators, incorporating preschooler-appropriate grammar (simple sentences, repetitive expressions) and vocabulary (3-5 syllable words)",
    "Develop and apply a computational thinking educational toolkit combining physical activities (block arrangement, role-playing) with language expressions (command verbalization, sequencing explanations), including picture cards, story templates, and role-play scenarios considering early childhood language development"
