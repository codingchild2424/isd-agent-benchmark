  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Secondary education experience, basic gifted education concepts, foundational grammar/text analysis skills, and reading experience across genres (expository, argumentative, literary texts)",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",

    "additional_context": "Process for in-service secondary teachers to acquire and apply blended learning strategies for holistically developing gifted students' language competencies (reading, writing, listening, speaking). Application to actual lesson design through project-based assessment, with a focus on enhancing advanced language expressiveness (complex sentence structures, academic vocabulary usage) and critical reading skills (analyzing hidden meanings, identifying logical fallacies). Digital literacy (online collaboration tools) and metalinguistic awareness (reflective understanding of language systems) are also strengthened.",

    "Design and implement personalized educational strategies for gifted students in a blended learning environment, considering advanced language inquiry skills (grammar system analysis, vocabulary expansion strategies, complex text interpretation)",
    "Learners interact at least twice weekly with three or more peers via synchronous (real-time video conferencing) and asynchronous (forums, emails) online activities, conduct peer evaluations based on a feedback rubric (Expression: Vocabulary Diversity, Sentence Structure, Creativity / Reading Comprehension: Text Analysis, Critical Thinking, Contextual Understanding), and submit a final output meeting at least four out of six rubric criteria by the course’s conclusion",
    "Through project-based assessment, learners develop three or more language education materials (activity sheets, worksheets, digital content, etc.) applicable to real educational settings (elementary, secondary, adult), and receive evaluations of \"B\" (80–89 points) or higher in at least four out of five expert evaluation rubric categories (Grammatical Accuracy, Vocabulary Diversity, Text Cohesion, Creativity, Field Applicability)"
