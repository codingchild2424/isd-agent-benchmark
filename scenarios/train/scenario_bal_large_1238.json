  "title": "[Large-Scale] Virtual Reality-Based Language Leadership Simulation: Integration of Constructivist Pedagogy with Text and Expression Analysis (Reflecting Cultural Context)",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational language education theories (grammatical structures, discourse analysis), leadership experience, digital text interpretation skills, basic multicultural awareness, and vocabulary application abilities",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Simulation/VR-based",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Immersive digital training for multinational team leadership scenarios. Learners practice cross-cultural communication strategies (real-time translation, situational grammar, nonverbal cues) in virtual meeting rooms. All interactions are recorded via text/performance analysis.",
    "institution_type": "Corporate/Enterprise",
    "learner_age": "40s and above",
    "learner_education": "High school",
    "learner_role": "Office worker (administrative/management)",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners analyze language-based communication strategies (vocabulary selection, nonverbal expression, situational grammar application) considering cultural differences in VR environments with 80% accuracy and can evaluate discourse structure and cultural adaptation elements.",
    "In collaborative tasks based on constructivist pedagogy, learners achieve at least 15 weekly instances of linguistic interaction (feedback exchange, argumentation, collaborative writing) and measure improvements in expressive and reading skills through peer assessment systems.",
    "In a digital simulation environment, learners develop one language leadership strategy meeting project-based evaluation criteria (reading accuracy ≥80%, expressiveness ≥Level 2 on a 3-point scale, cultural adaptation checklist ≥3 of 5 items), receive validity approval from two of three peer evaluators, and systematically organize writing and expression examples in a portfolio."
