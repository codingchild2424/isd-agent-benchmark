    "Applying the 4 stages of the TE-RME framework (Exploration, Expansion, Restructuring, Evaluation), learners design 3 math problems reflecting cultural contexts (e.g., holidays, traditional games), optimize linguistic expressions (text structure, vocabulary selection) during problem-solving, and achieve an \"Excellent\" grade in ≥2 of 4 peer evaluation rubric items (creativity, cultural appropriateness, mathematical accuracy, linguistic clarity).",
    "Learners complete ≥3 digital tool-based (GeoGebra, Padlet, etc.) math proficiency assessment tasks and strengthen communication skills through oral/written explanations of their results.",
    "Incorporating ≥3 peer feedbacks, learners submit a job-linked math lesson design proposal for corporate settings 3 days before course completion, achieving an \"Excellent\" grade in ≥4 of 5 rubric items (problem design, cultural integration, mathematical accuracy, linguistic expression, practicality)."
