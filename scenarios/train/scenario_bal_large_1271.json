  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational mathematics education theories (number concepts, geometry, measurement, patterns), experience with digital media, understanding of early childhood cognitive development stages, and basic problem-solving and graph interpretation skills in mathematics",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Simulation/VR-based",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Enhancing the capability to design math games for young children in smartphone-centric limited-technology environments: optimizing touch-based interfaces (drag-and-drop), internalizing math concepts through gamification elements (scores, levels, rewards), and increasing learning effectiveness via multisensory stimulation (animation/sound effects). It systematically connects calculation, geometry, and pattern domains.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Design three learning objectives for early childhood math games based on the Dick & Carey model: addition/subtraction problem-solving to strengthen basic calculation skills, shape manipulation (rotation/symmetry) for spatial sense development, and pattern recognition to foster logical thinking (discovering regularities).",
    "Applying R&D methodology (requirements analysis–design–development–testing), learners develop one digital game prototype (with formula visualization and graph-based feedback), implement three or more interactive problem-solving scenarios (equation solving, shape classification, pattern completion), and apply a gamification evaluation system (scores/badges/level-ups) to achieve over 80% user satisfaction.",
    "Implement two early childhood learning effectiveness assessment tools via VR simulation: in-game behavioral data analysis (problem-solving time/attempts) and a mathematical concept comprehension rubric (calculation accuracy, shape recognition, pattern prediction)."
