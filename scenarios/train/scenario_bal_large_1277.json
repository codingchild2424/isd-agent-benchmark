  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Elementary mathematics basics (arithmetic, geometry, measurement) and teaching experience, basic formula calculation and graph interpretation skills. Additionally, ability to solve simple equations and foundational data analysis competencies",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A blended education course for current elementary mathematics practitioners, conducted in real-time online environments via smartphones. Practical application skills are measured through project-based assessments, with a focus on evaluating mathematical problem-solving processes and data analysis capabilities. Learners apply scientific inquiry methods in experimental design and result interpretation.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners integrate learner-centered and knowledge-centered instructional methods by developing a lesson model using dynamic educational system design principles and mathematical formula/equation analysis. They particularly establish teaching strategies reflecting probabilistic thinking and statistical reasoning.",
    "Learners design flexible instructional strategies for reorganizing elementary mathematics curricula using digital tools (e.g., GeoGebra, Desmos) and mathematical graph interpretation techniques, applying function relationship analysis and data visualization methods.",
    "Learners conduct three or more real-time mathematics classes for groups of 10+ learners on a smartphone-based interactive platform and achieve over 80 points on a predefined rubric (participation 30%, conceptual understanding 40%, technology utilization 30%). They apply mathematical proofs and statistical analysis techniques during problem-solving, including hypothesis verification and error analysis procedures."
