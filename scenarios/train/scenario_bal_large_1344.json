    "Applying sociocultural constructivist principles (e.g., collaborative knowledge-building, reflective dialogue) on an online discussion board, learners can provide at least three specific feedbacks per week on peers’ mathematical ideas and write a 500-word reflective summary of their own thinking processes based on the discussions."
