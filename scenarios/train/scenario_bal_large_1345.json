  "title": "[Large-scale] Workshop on Blended Learning-based Cell Biology Teaching Methods: Integration of Scientific Inquiry and Language Strategies",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic biology knowledge (cellular terminology and concepts), educational experience, proficiency in basic grammar and scientific text comprehension. Capable of understanding academic vocabulary and complex sentence structures",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Activity-based blended learning program for pre-service/in-service teachers to enhance cell biology education competencies. Emphasizes teaching strategies for improving scientific literacy (academic writing, presentation skills) and language expression. Establishes integrated language learning environments through lab report writing and discussion activities.",
    "institution_type": "Public/Non-profit educational institution",
    "learner_age": "In their 30s",
    "learner_education": "Adult learner (non-degree)",
    "learner_role": "Pre-service/In-service teacher",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can systematically explain core concepts of cell structure and function using the scientific inquiry process (hypothesis-experiment-conclusion) and specialized terminology (cell membrane, mitochondria, protein synthesis, etc.).",
    "Learners can design activity-based instructional methods in blended learning environments and apply language-integrated strategies (text analysis, vocabulary expansion, academic expression training) considering learners’ reading and expressive abilities.",
    "Educators can design teaching strategies for each stage—hypothesis formulation (problem definition and variable identification), experimental analysis (data visualization and pattern recognition), and conclusion drawing (causal reasoning and evidence-based argumentation)—within a week and develop lesson materials meeting at least 4 of 5 peer-evaluation rubric criteria (e.g., clarity, practicality, engagement, linguistic accuracy, feedback effectiveness)."
