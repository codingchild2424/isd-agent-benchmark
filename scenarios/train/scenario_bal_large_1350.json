  "title": "[Large-Scale] Virtual Reality (VR) Integrated Instructional Design for Medical Education Innovation: Strengthening Social Interaction and Patient-Centered Competencies",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic medical procedures, experience with digital devices, foundational awareness of medical ethics and patient rights, basic communication skills for building social relationships",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Conducted in a practical smartphone-based VR education environment, this course includes scenarios for building provider-patient social relationships and cultural sensitivity. Particularly enhances awareness of social equity through patient simulations representing diverse socioeconomic backgrounds.",
    "institution_type": "Public/Non-profit educational institution",
    "learner_age": "In their 30s",
    "learner_education": "Adult learner (non-degree)",
    "learner_role": "Student",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can improve cognitive problem-solving skills and patient-centered medical decision-making competencies by performing at least three complex medical simulations using VR technology, while exploring ways to ensure patient rights within healthcare systems.",
    "Learners can perform at least three patient interaction scenarios in a 30-minute immersive VR environment and be evaluated on emotional empathy (minimum 5 empathetic responses/scenario) and emotional recognition accuracy (80% or higher) to enhance emotional empathy and social communication skills. This strengthens cultural sensitivity and medical ethics as a citizen.",
    "Learners can achieve at least 80% proficiency in two medical skills (e.g., injection administration, wound care) using smartphone-based VR tools and cultivate attitudes respecting medical ethics and patient rights. They can refine communication skills in power dynamics between healthcare providers and patients."
