  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic machine learning concepts, general understanding of indoor positioning systems, foundational knowledge of text preprocessing and embedding techniques, basic NLP (grammar, vocabulary, text analysis), and introductory spatial representation modeling",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A process exploring AI technology applications for real-life problem-solving. Focuses on the operational principles of fingerprint-based location recognition systems and transfer learning techniques, particularly emphasizing spatial representation optimization and domain-specific language pattern analysis (specialized vocabulary and contextual structures in medical/legal/financial fields). Learners comprehensively develop text-based spatial context understanding and domain adaptation skills.",

    "learner_age": "In their 30s",
    "learner_education": "Middle school",
    "learner_role": "Professional (medical/legal/technical)",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can explain the fundamental principles of transfer learning and its application to indoor positioning systems from a language data processing perspective, and propose text-based spatial representation optimization strategies.",
    "Learners can verbally/verbally explain 3 core principles of metric learning (embedding space design, similarity function optimization, loss function selection) in fingerprint data-based indoor positioning systems within 5 minutes, implement a model achieving ≥85% similarity prediction accuracy using text representation optimization techniques (e.g., TF-IDF, Word2Vec) within a week, and enhance spatial contextual understanding through domain-specific vocabulary analysis.",
    "Learners can apply metric transfer techniques using source domain (daily conversation) knowledge to 3 target domain datasets (medical/legal/financial) at the end of a 1-week course, and submit an experimental report demonstrating ≥15% improvement in transfer accuracy via domain-specific vocabulary analysis and contextual expression optimization."
