  "title": "Large-Scale Hypervideo-Based Language Learning Course Design: Integrated Text, Listening, and Expression with a Structured Feedback System",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic digital literacy and foundational language proficiency (daily conversational grammar, vocabulary, listening), understanding of text analysis and basic writing techniques",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "In smartphone-centric constrained technological environments, emphasizes multimodal approaches combining real-time interaction (chat/voice) and self-directed learning activities (text analysis/writing practice) to enhance learners' expressive, reading, and listening skills.",
    "institution_type": "Corporate/Enterprise",
    "learner_age": "40s and above",
    "learner_education": "Adult learner (non-degree)",
    "learner_role": "Office worker (administrative/management)",
    "domain_expertise": "Beginner"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can create personal notes analyzing core vocabulary and grammatical structures in language learning content using hypervideo tools and enhance contextual comprehension through text structure analysis.",
    "Learners engage in collaborative reading and speaking activities based on verbal and text feedback from peers and instructors during real-time sessions, applying communication strategies.",
    "Within a week, learners can write at least five structured annotations on core grammar, vocabulary, and expressions for three or more learning modules using public/private annotation features on a corporate LMS, incorporate at least two peer feedbacks, submit a final learning report, and integrate writing and reading skills.",
    "After a one-week intensive course, learners perform project-based assessments for corporate work scenarios (email writing, video conferencing, customer service) and apply language skills (grammar accuracy ≥85%, use of ≥10 business vocabulary items, pronunciation clarity ≥4/5) with 80% accuracy, demonstrating expression skills required in real work environments."
