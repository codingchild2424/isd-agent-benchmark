    "Learners can develop one animation-based social studies lesson model through project-based assessment over 2–4 weeks, achieve an average of 4 or higher on peer and instructor evaluation rubrics (5-point scale, four items), and analyze implementation results with quantitative data (participation rate over 80%) and qualitative feedback (student surveys)."
