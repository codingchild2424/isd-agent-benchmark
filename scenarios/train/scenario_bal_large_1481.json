    "Explain the principles of data distribution change detection in Adaptive Risk Prediction Systems (ARPS) through case-based analysis",
    "Learners must explain at least three key differences between transfer learning and incremental learning, then select three industry scenarios (e.g., manufacturing defect detection, customer service chatbot updates) where each method is more suitable, providing technical justifications (e.g., model retraining costs, data efficiency) for comparison.",
    "Learners must update machine learning models at least twice using eight years of real industrial data (e.g., manufacturing process data) and interpret performance metric changes (accuracy, RMSE, etc.) showing at least a 5% improvement.",
    "Learners must write a system parameter analysis report considering test throughput (over 50 cases per hour) and disease incidence rates (5 per 1,000 population by region) for medical field applications, achieving an \"Excellent\" grade in at least four of five peer evaluation rubric criteria."
