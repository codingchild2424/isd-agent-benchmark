  "title": "[Large-Scale] Virtual Learning Instructional Design Strategies for Online Nursing Education: Integrating Medical Terminology-Based Language Pedagogy and Clinical Context Analysis",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational nursing theories and teaching experience, comprehension of basic medical terminology (symptoms, diagnoses, treatments, protocols, etc.), experience using specialized terminology in clinical contexts, basic competence in educational material design and assessment tool development",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A language-centered education program for pre-service nurse educators, integrating medical terminology (symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, protocols, etc.) and pedagogical methods. The course focuses on enhancing learners' clinical contextual understanding and professional terminology usage, aiming to cultivate effective communication skills in real clinical settings through text analysis, role-playing, and discussion forums.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can apply three or more instructional design strategies promoting learner-content interaction in online environments (medical terminology-based text analysis, virtual simulation-based problem solving, multimedia integration) while evaluating contextual accuracy of medical terminology and clinical application skills",
    "Learners can design two types of collaborative activities (learner-instructor and learner-learner) on virtual learning platforms (e.g., medical terminology-based discussion forums, clinical case studies through role-play, symptom-diagnosis-treatment linkage writing activities) and analyze appropriateness of professional terminology use and communication efficiency",
    "In blended nursing education environments, learners can develop effectiveness evaluation tools incorporating at least three formative assessment items (10-question online medical terminology quiz, 5-step practical checklist, 3-item peer evaluation report), receive validity verification of 80%+ from an expert review panel (three or more members) within four weeks, and ensure the tool comprehensively measures terminology accuracy, clinical context comprehension, and communication skills"
