  "title": "Optimizing Language-Based Knowledge Transfer in International Joint Ventures: An Integrated Approach to Communication, Adaptation, and Simulation",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Inter-organizational collaboration experience, basic international business concepts, ability to distinguish tacit/implicit knowledge, foundational business English/multilingual communication (grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation), cultural context comprehension.",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Simulation/VR-based",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Implementation of international joint venture scenarios in VR environments (multilingual text/voice interaction), simulation of knowledge sharing among multinational teams (role-playing, negotiation dialogues), analysis of language mediator roles (translation/interpretation strategies), and reflection of cultural contexts (idiomatic expressions, formality level adjustments).",
    "institution_type": "Corporate/Enterprise",
    "learner_age": "In their 30s",
    "learner_education": "Middle school",
    "learner_role": "Professional (medical/legal/technical)",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners analyze explicit knowledge transfer mechanisms in international joint ventures using structural equation modeling and evaluate linguistic communication strategies (e.g., vocabulary selection, grammatical accuracy, cultural expression adaptation).",
    "Learners explain the differential impact of psychic distance on tacit/explicit knowledge transfer and language adaptation (e.g., idiomatic expressions, nonverbal communication).",
    "Learners analyze three language barrier overcoming scenarios in virtual simulations (e.g., Crisis Simulation Platform) by comparing text/spoken communication, develop strategic action plans applying four or more stages of a five-step decision-making framework, and achieve an average score of 4/5 or higher in peer and instructor evaluations."
