  "title": "Academic Library Information Retrieval Education: Social Science Research Material Search Strategies and Citizen Participation-Based Document Learning Effectiveness Improvement Plan",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic understanding of smartphone usage, general information retrieval experience, foundational knowledge of social science topics (history/geography/culture/politics/economics, etc.), basic concepts of civic engagement",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learners primarily access the LMS via smartphones, requiring self-directed learning in non-real-time environments. Educational materials should be provided in mobile-friendly formats (text/infographics/interactive charts) optimized for social science research. They are structured around real-world social phenomena (citizen rights, institutional improvements, cultural relations) such as local community issue analysis and policy document searches.",

    "learner_age": "40s and above",
    "learner_education": "Middle school",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can accurately interpret evidence-based documents in social science research materials (history/geography/culture/politics, etc.) describing online academic library database search procedures with over 80% accuracy.",
    "Learners can successfully search for academic materials related to specific social issues (e.g., population changes, cultural policies) three or more times using the provided search guide and structure analysis results from the perspective of promoting civic rights.",
    "Based on a week-long experience using document-based guides (library manuals, online FAQs, etc.) during information searches, learners can write a reflective journal including three search strategies linked to social science research methodologies (hypothesis setting-variable control-conclusion drawing) and two information utilization improvements, and submit it at the end of the process."
