    "Preservice teachers will be able to explain the differences between confirmatory and structured inquiry and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of each.",
    "Preservice teachers can evaluate the impact of inquiry-based learning on learners' success expectations and intrinsic value based on expectancy-value theory.",
    "Preservice teachers can design non-face-to-face inquiry-based science lessons in an LMS environment and monitor learner engagement through formative assessment."
