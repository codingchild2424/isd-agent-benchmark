    "additional_context": "Learners access the LMS via personal devices (BYOD), with project-based assessments (real-world math problem-solving tasks) measuring learning outcomes. As a beginner-level math curriculum, it experimentally verifies how instructors’ visual/verbal expression methods affect learning outcomes (problem-solving skills, conceptual understanding). Content balances algebra, geometry, and statistics, systematically covering graph interpretation, probability calculations, and proof processes",

    "Learners solve 80 math problems (20 per type: original/idealized/virtual/none) and analyze significant differences (p-value < 0.05) in average accuracy (%) and conceptual understanding survey scores (5-point Likert scale) across types using t-tests or ANOVA. Accuracy in equation, function, and geometry problem-solving is evaluated based on formula and graph interpretation.",
    "Learners listen to 10 AI-generated math lecture samples (3 voice types: original/altered/synthesized, covering equations, functions, geometry), compare average satisfaction scores (5-point Likert scale) across types, and propose the top 2 types with ≥ 0.5-point differences as optimal strategies. Analysis focuses on probabilistic clarity and proof delivery effectiveness per voice type.",
    "Learners measure perceived social presence and academic emotions (boredom, immersion) to investigate how image/voice types affect mathematical concept acquisition. Regression analysis and correlation coefficients derive relationships between learning outcomes and emotional factors."
