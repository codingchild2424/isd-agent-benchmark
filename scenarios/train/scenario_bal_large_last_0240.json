    "Acquiring skills to produce and operate IVR content in a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) environment",
    "During the 4-week intermediate course, learners can design one science class model using IVR (virtual reality) technology, present development outcomes meeting at least four of five project-based evaluation checklist items, and achieve a combined score of 80+ points from peer and instructor evaluations.",
    "Learners can design three engagement-enhancing strategies for 30-something learners at vocational training institutions using IVR (Immersive Virtual Reality) technology, executable within two weeks, and achieve over 80% satisfaction in peer evaluations and instructor feedback."
