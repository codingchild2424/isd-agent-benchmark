  "title": "Science Teachers' Online Inquiry Instructional Competency Enhancement Course Using Micro-Credentials: Integration of Scientific Inquiry Processes",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic digital tool proficiency, foundational science subject knowledge, and understanding of scientific inquiry methods (experimental design, variable control, data interpretation)",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Customized for in-service science teachers, this program aims to overcome limitations of online learning environments through mixed methodologies and constructivist approaches, enhancing digital learning identity and scientific inquiry competencies. Special emphasis is placed on effectively integrating core elements of science education—experimental design, data analysis, and evidence-based conclusions—into online settings.",
    "institution_type": "Vocational training institution",
    "learner_age": "In their 30s",
    "learner_education": "Adult learner (non-degree)",

    "domain_expertise": "Beginner"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners understand the operational principles of micro-credentials and establish utilization plans linked to the scientific inquiry process (hypothesis setting → experimental design → variable control → data analysis → conclusion).",
    "In constructivist online learning environments (Google Workspace, Padlet, etc.), learners collaborate in teams of 3–5 to design a four-week project for digital learning identity development (e.g., e-portfolio, learning blog). They submit science-based outcomes (e.g., experiment data visualization, analysis reports) meeting ≥4 of 5 peer review and instructor feedback criteria.",
    "Through LMS-based project outcomes, learners earn ≥3 micro-credentials proving online science inquiry teaching competencies (e.g., virtual experiment design, variable control, data analysis, scientific argumentation)."
