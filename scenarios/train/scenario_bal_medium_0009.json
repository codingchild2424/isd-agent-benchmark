  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic understanding of secondary curriculum and language pedagogy (grammar, vocabulary, discourse analysis), field experience (practice/observation), foundational research methodology (literature review, data collection)",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Combining workbook activities using digital devices with online collaboration tools (Padlet, Google Workspace) and face-to-face mentoring. Comprehensive evaluation of learners' language analysis skills (text interpretation, communication strategy assessment) and field applicability (multicultural education, subject-integrated vocabulary activities).",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Write an action research plan systematically analyzing classroom language use issues (e.g., dialects, slang, communication strategies) following the five stages of the ADDIE Model.",
    "Learners can review three or more academic papers (linguistics, education fields) on adolescent language use patterns, derive two or more core language concepts (e.g., pragmatic strategies, discourse analysis, language variation), visualize them as a concept map, and write a report explaining the research problem’s validity with three justifications (social necessity, academic gap, feasibility).",
    "Learners can collect three classroom language data samples (1 student conversation record, 2+ in-class language use cases) using tools like Google Forms, surveys, and observation logs, and write a 2-page A4 proposal suggesting two or more language education improvements (e.g., 1 multicultural student support strategy, 1 subject-specific vocabulary activity), meeting four or more of five teacher evaluation rubric criteria."
