  "title": "Language Communication Simulation for Community-Based Medical Career Exploration: Integrated Training in Professional Terminology and Empathetic Expression",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic medical terminology (e.g., 'symptoms', 'treatment'), understanding of the diagnostic process (initial/follow-up procedures), fundamental patient-provider communication skills (active listening, constructing medical questions, empathetic responses)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Simulation/VR-based",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Comparative analysis of community healthcare scenarios (empathic language observation) and hospital simulations (medical jargon accuracy evaluation) in smartphone-based VR. Observes and documents language expression (medical vs. colloquial translation), listening skills (symptom summarization vs. emotional reflection), and nonverbal communication (gestures, facial expressions, eye contact) required in each context",
    "institution_type": "University (undergraduate)",
    "learner_age": "In their 20s",
    "learner_education": "Middle school",
    "learner_role": "Student",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will identify and apply ≥3 communication skills required in community-based medical settings: medical vocabulary (e.g., \"hypertension,\" \"diabetes management\"), patient symptom-listening techniques (open-ended questions, empathetic reflection), and treatment explanation skills (metaphors, simplification).",
    "Learners will compare and analyze ≥3 differences in communication styles between hospital (formal/technical: \"diagnosis,\" \"medical rationale\") and community-based (informal/empathic: \"everyday language translation,\" \"emotional support\") care environments via VR simulation.",
    "Learners will write a 1-page medical career plan within a week meeting: 1) ≥3 specific career preference changes (e.g., \"clinical research → community health education\"), 2) ≥5 accurate medical terms (e.g., \"preventive medicine,\" \"patient-centered care\"), and 3) ≥2 \"excellent\" ratings on a 3-item rubric (clarity, expertise, logic)."
