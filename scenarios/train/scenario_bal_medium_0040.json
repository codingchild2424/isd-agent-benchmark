  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can explain core calculus concepts (limits, continuity, rates of change) by manipulating 3D graphs in a VR environment.",
    "Learners collaborate in 4-member teams to document 3-step math problem-solving processes using multimodal expressions (2 visual models, 10-minute audio explanation, 500-character text annotations) and achieve 'B+' or higher in 4 out of 5 peer assessment rubric items.",
    "Learners can analyze data collected from VR simulations, represent real-world phenomena (e.g., fluid dynamics) as mathematical models, and present their findings."
