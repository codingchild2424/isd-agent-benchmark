    "Participants will select ≥2 AI tools for language learning (e.g., automated writing evaluation systems, ChatGPT) and develop a three-stage instructional design strategy: ① tool functionality analysis → ② language learning activity design → ③ evaluation rubric development. In peer feedback sessions, the strategy must achieve ≥80% ratings in ≥2 of three feasibility criteria: technical suitability, learning effectiveness, and practicality.",
    "For AIED professional development, participants will propose ≥3 institutional support measures (e.g., customized training programs, mentoring systems, research funding) and achieve an average ≥4.0 on an institutional feasibility evaluation rubric (5-point scale)."
