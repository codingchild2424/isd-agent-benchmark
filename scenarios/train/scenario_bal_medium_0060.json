  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic smartphone usage understanding, general information retrieval experience, foundational knowledge of social science topics (e.g., social stratification, cultural diversity, civic rights), and basic experience in academic literature searches",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learners primarily access the LMS via smartphones, requiring self-directed learning in non-real-time environments. Educational materials must be mobile-friendly, with content structured around social science research methodologies (literature analysis, data interpretation, historical context analysis). Particularly emphasizes approaches stressing resource retrieval and critical analysis for community problem-solving.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will accurately interpret social science document-based materials explaining academic library database search procedures with ≥80% accuracy and evaluate their relevance to research topics.",
    "Learners will successfully locate academic resources related to specific social issues (e.g., demographic changes, regional economic development) ≥3 times using provided search guides and perform analyses considering cultural contexts.",
    "Based on 1-week experiences using document-based guides (e.g., library manuals, online tutorials) in social science information searches, learners will record ≥3 specific cases in reflective journals, each including ≥150-character reflective analyses (e.g., credibility assessment, topic relevance, societal impact)."
