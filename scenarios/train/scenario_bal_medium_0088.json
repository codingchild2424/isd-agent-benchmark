  "title": "Real-World Financial Decision-Making Simulation: Applying Scientific Inquiry Methods to Accounting Ethics and Crisis Management",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic accounting principles, understanding of financial systems, foundational concepts in scientific inquiry (experimental design, hypothesis formulation, data analysis), and ability to interpret financial data",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "In a simulation environment based on real corporate financial data, learners apply the scientific methodology (hypothesis→experiment→analysis→conclusion) to gain practical financial decision-making experience. In financial crisis scenarios, they conduct experiments controlling various variables to predict decision impacts and experience formulating ethical judgments and crisis management strategies based on analytical results.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can experiment with and observe financial reporting processes under different accounting policies across various scenarios and systematically analyze results under controlled variables.",
    "Learners can apply scientific inquiry methods in accounting ethics dilemmas by setting hypotheses and collecting evidence, derive data-driven professional judgment standards, and make ethical decisions.",
    "Learners can establish coordination and collaboration strategies among stakeholders during corporate crises and measure/evaluate their effectiveness using quantitative and qualitative metrics."
