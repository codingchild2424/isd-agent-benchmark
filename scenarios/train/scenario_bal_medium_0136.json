  "learning_goals": [
    "Novice teachers can apply a framework to evaluate the scalability/limitations of learning support systems in their educational contexts",
    "Within six months, learners can develop a practical plan to collaborate with three peer teachers and two local science museums/research institutes, secure five or more types of science education resources (experiment kits, digital content, etc.), and write an implementation report.",
    "Through participatory observation (analysis of twice-weekly class recordings) and reflective practice (weekly reflective journaling), learners can identify three major challenges in their teaching adaptation process, propose two or more actionable improvement strategies, and receive an execution feasibility rating of 4/5 or higher from a supervising teacher."
