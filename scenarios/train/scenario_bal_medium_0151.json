    "Learners can regularly self-assess 21st-century citizen competencies (creativity, collaboration, critical thinking) during maker project implementation",
    "Learners utilize gamification elements (level-up, reward system) to establish a competency development plan at least three times weekly for two weeks, submit five or more reflective journals by course completion, and achieve 4 points or higher (5-point scale) in the motivation sustainability category from peer evaluations and instructor feedback",
    "During a mid-term course (2-4 weeks), learners set one maker learning goal, execute three or more customized activities (design/production/testing) according to a weekly plan, and submit deliverables (prototype or report) and activity logs at course completion to verify meeting evaluation criteria (80%+ goal achievement). This measures effects on social relationship formation and citizenship enhancement"
