  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic mathematical concepts (equations, functions, statistics) and job-related foundational competencies (data analysis, project management), understanding of mathematical proofs, and graph interpretation skills",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A process analyzing teacher collaboration cases in digital environments to establish math learning improvement strategies and apply them to real projects (problem-solving PBL). Focus areas include enhancing learners' computational skills, graph interpretation, and statistical thinking. Activities specifically target strengthening equation-solving, function visualization, and probabilistic reasoning abilities.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Through analysis of teacher collaboration systems, learners can derive ≥3 student-centered math learning strategies (equation solving, function visualization, statistical analysis).",
    "By analyzing 3 international PBL collaboration cases from Hong Kong and Singapore, learners can design 2 collaboration competency enhancement plans (mathematical proof-based communication, graph interpretation accuracy, probability-based statistics) applicable to project management processes, achieving ≥4 on a 5-point team performance scale in a 4-week P4BL project.",
    "Within six months, learners can analyze formative assessment data (≥100 learners) to identify 3 learner error patterns (calculation errors, formula misapplication, graph misinterpretation), develop a customized feedback algorithm (≥5 rules), and validate a 20% satisfaction improvement over existing systems via A/B testing."
