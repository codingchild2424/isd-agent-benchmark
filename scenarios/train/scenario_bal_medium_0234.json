  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can explain the motion principles of solar system celestial bodies with over 80% accuracy using astronomical simulation tools.",
    "Learners maintain joint attention with peers during three or more collaborative tasks while discussing concepts.",
    "Learners present group problem-solving strategies in a logical structure of three or more stages through multimodal (text/audio/gesture) interactions.",
    "At the end of the six-month course, learners achieve a rubric-based competency level of four or higher in deriving scientific conclusions from simulation data."
