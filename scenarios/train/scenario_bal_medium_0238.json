Particularly focusing on designing integrated activities for expression, reading comprehension, and pronunciation to overcome language barriers between older adults and adolescents. Attention to improving language use abilities reflecting cultural contexts",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Design three or more intergenerational language-learning scenarios using AR technology, emphasizing text-voice interaction and cultural context reflection.",
    "Explain a multi-layered language activity design method that integrates vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation learning elements while applying PISEC’s seven group learning principles to AR exhibition design.",
    "Learners will demonstrate ≥3 collaborative learning activities using smartphone-based AR tools (e.g., Google Lens, Quiver) and create evaluation forms that include specific feedback (≥4 items) on peers’ expressive and reading tasks: sentence structure, lexical choice, cultural appropriateness, and pronunciation clarity.",
    "Learners will analyze three AR language interaction scenarios involving ≥3 generations (youth, middle-aged, elderly) and establish 5-point scale evaluation criteria for four communication effectiveness metrics (clarity, engagement, cultural fit, linguistic accuracy), achieving ≥85% evaluator agreement."
