  "learning_goals": [
    "Cohort members can collaboratively develop a step-by-step roadmap from topic selection to data analysis, systematically structuring text using academic vocabulary and expression strategies aligned with research objectives.",
    "Learners can draft one research design using an integrated thesis guidance model (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude), critically analyze five or more academic papers, and produce one research interpretation report. They can also complete one abstract and three structured text sections (introduction/methods/conclusion) adhering to APA style guidelines.",
    "Based on peer feedback and instructor support, learners can develop strategies to optimize time management and workload while enhancing their ability to systematically present research findings and strengthen logical organization."
