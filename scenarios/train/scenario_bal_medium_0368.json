    "At the end of the mid-term course (4 weeks), learners can communicate with at least 80% accuracy in the target language (L2) in seven or more out of ten everyday situations (shopping, hospital visits, public transportation use, etc.).",
    "Learners analyze three language use scenarios reflecting intercultural understanding in XR environments (e.g., VR cultural experience platforms) and write at least two dialogues per scenario considering cultural context, achieving an \"excellent\" rating in at least two out of three peer-assessment rubric items (cultural appropriateness, linguistic accuracy, creativity).",
    "Development of adaptive capacity to receive personalized language feedback through interaction with AI-based conversational agents.",
    "Learners, in groups of three, establish two language teaching strategies applicable to three types of real classroom situations (e.g., grammar explanation, role-play, feedback provision) and achieve an average score of at least 4 (on a 5-point scale) in peer assessments and instructor feedback."
