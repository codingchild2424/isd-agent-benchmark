    "prior_knowledge": "Graduate-level foundational mathematics knowledge (calculus, linear algebra, probability theory, statistical modeling), basic understanding of self-regulated learning, and mathematical problem-solving experience (applying formulas, graph analysis, proof writing)",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A smartphone-based learning environment with mixed student/job-seeking participants, applying advanced mathematical concepts (probability theory, statistical modeling) and designing activities to enhance mathematical thinking (equation solving, data visualization, statistical analysis).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners systematically apply self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies in a blended learning environment to improve cognitive engagement in mathematical problem-solving processes (formula derivation, equation solving, graph interpretation) by at least 30%.",
    "Learners use collaborative self-regulated learning (CoRL) techniques to measurably enhance emotional engagement in mathematics learning (20% increase in problem-solving focus time, participation in statistical modeling error analysis).",
    "Learners utilize weekly instructor feedback (at least three times) and structured step-by-step assignments (five stages: concept understanding–formula application–problem solving–error analysis–comprehensive evaluation) to maintain a score of 4 or higher (on a 5-point scale) in mathematics learning immersion surveys for 8 weeks and improve accuracy in solving probability theory and statistical modeling problems by 25%.",
    "Learners select 1–2 self-regulated strategies (e.g., time management for solving math problems, creating a learning environment, motivation) suitable to the situation when switching between online/offline modes and maintain at least 80% academic achievement (assignment submission rate, exam scores, proof problem-solving rate) compared to weekly learning plans for four consecutive weeks."
