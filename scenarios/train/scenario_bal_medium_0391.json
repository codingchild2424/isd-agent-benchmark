    "Participating teachers can produce and utilize 3+ OERs for math education (equation solving, graph analysis, statistical data) within a week.",
    "Applying a feedback-based assessment system, teachers will achieve an 85%+ peer review completion rate with colleagues and be evaluated on their ability to provide specific feedback on problem-solving processes.",
    "Learners can design three or more mathematics educational materials using VLE tools (QuizMaker, LMS) and external OER, with each material including at least two mathematical expressions (e.g., LaTeX) and one graph generation feature (e.g., GeoGebra), and submit outcomes meeting at least four of the five evaluation rubric criteria.",
    "Learners acquire the ability to visually represent learning achievements using a digital badge system and design competency badges for specific mathematical concepts (e.g., equations, probability, statistics)."
