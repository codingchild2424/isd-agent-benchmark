    "Learners accurately understand and utilize 200 essential foreign language vocabulary items within cultural contexts and social phenomena (e.g., civic engagement, economic disparity, multicultural policies) over 4 weeks.",
    "Learners achieve over 80% vocabulary memorization accuracy via quizzes after watching educational videos and explain sociocultural implications (e.g., policy changes, inter-class relations, global trends).",
    "Learners select 10 social phenomenon-related vocabulary items (e.g., civic engagement, economic disparity, multicultural policies) from video content, create 3+ real-situation scenarios (e.g., news analysis, debate topics, policy proposals) using the vocabulary, and achieve over 80% suitability in peer/teacher feedback."
