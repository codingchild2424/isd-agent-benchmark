  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Fundamental problem-solving abilities, digital device utilization skills, basic grammar comprehension and text interpretation capabilities, and foundational vocabulary expansion skills.",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course focusing on cultivating real-world problem-solving abilities (resolving communication barriers, text restructuring, context-based expression optimization) through CPS training integrated with language subjects (reading, writing, speaking, listening). Learners analyze texts across genres (expository, argumentative, creative) to acquire creative problem-solving strategies.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can systematically address language-related problems (analyzing complex text structures, diagnosing vocabulary usage errors) from discovery to acceptance planning using the CPS 6-stage model",
    "Learners can apply creative thinking skills (idea generation, diversifying expressions, metaphor creation) in a blended learning environment combining digital tools (pads/tablets) and paper-based activities (writing notebooks, vocabulary maps, concept mapping)",
    "Learners can enhance critical thinking skills (text critique, alternative expression exploration, context-based restructuring) through iterative solution refinement incorporating peer feedback (evaluating grammatical accuracy, logical coherence, lexical appropriateness)"
