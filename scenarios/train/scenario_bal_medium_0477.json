They achieve an \"Excellent\" grade in at least two of the three peer evaluation rubric items: clarity, analytical depth, and practicality.",
    "Identify at least three social factors to consider when designing a machine learning system tailored to a specific sociocultural context (language processing).",
    "Learners analyze given AI project outputs (model predictions, data distributions) to visualize model explainability using at least two techniques (e.g., SHAP/LIME), propose at least three bias management strategies at the data preprocessing/model design stages, and compile findings into a report within 10 pages."
