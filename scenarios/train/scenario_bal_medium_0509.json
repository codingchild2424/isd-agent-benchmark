Utilizes real-time interaction (feedback loops) and digital resources (graph generators, interactive charts). Includes practical tasks evaluating data analysis accuracy and graph interpretation skills.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "By applying cognitive load theory, learners optimize the presentation of mathematical concepts (equations, graphs, statistics) and develop strategies for efficient distribution across visual/auditory channels. Specifically, they design multimodal representations to enhance graph interpretation and statistical data analysis skills.",
    "Learners apply multimedia learning principles (dual-coding theory, cognitive load theory, etc.) to design a 3-minute integrated visual/auditory resource explaining mathematical concepts like function graphs and statistical charts. They achieve an \"excellent\" rating in four or more of five peer assessment rubric criteria, including data visualization accuracy and clarity of graph interpretation.",
    "Learners develop personalized mathematics instructional materials considering prior knowledge (basic calculation skills, formula application experience, probability understanding) and motivation (interest in problem-solving). Statistical chart case studies are incorporated to promote learning transfer."
