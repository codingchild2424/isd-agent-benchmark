    "Within one week, learners develop a prototype (minimum 2 scales implemented) that converts the three Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) items (motor function, verbal response, eye-opening) into a digital evaluation system using mathematical modeling techniques (e.g., regression analysis, weighted scoring) and submit results meeting four or more of the five peer evaluation rubric items.",
    "Within one week, teams of 3–4 members select two instructional design tasks on user interface optimization, proceed through a three-stage process (problem definition → solution development → prototype implementation), and submit a final report and demo video."
