  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic legal concepts (rights/obligations relationships), statutory analysis skills (cross-referencing legal provisions), legal text comprehension (concretizing abstract concepts), and grasp of specialized vocabulary (including synonyms/antonyms), along with basic knowledge of argumentation structures (e.g., syllogisms)",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Practice-centered education linked to project-based assessments (portfolios/peer review) in a digital device-provided environment. Language-integrated instruction focuses on improving learners' legal reading comprehension (inter-textual connectivity analysis), technical terminology proficiency (context-appropriate term selection), and argument structuring (hierarchical organization of issues). Cultivates practical language skills through analysis of actual court case texts.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Systematically analyze the textual structure of complex legal principles (e.g., civil service labor laws) using visual tools like Venn diagrams and interpret contextual meanings of legal terminology, including synonym/antonym relationships.",
    "Through 10 simulation-based case studies, learners will write problem-solving reports applying at least three legal concepts (contract law, criminal law, civil procedure law) to real situations (e.g., contract review, crime case analysis). They will achieve an \"Excellent\" rating in four of five rubric items evaluating legal reasoning (causality/evidence) and expression (terminological accuracy, clarity of sentence structure).",
    "Using collaborative tools (e.g., Miro, Google Docs), learners will complete projects mapping legal issues (keyword clustering) and structuring arguments (introduction-body-conclusion) with peers, enhancing report-writing skills through specialized terminology (including legal Latin) and logical expression techniques (transitional phrases, emphasis)."
