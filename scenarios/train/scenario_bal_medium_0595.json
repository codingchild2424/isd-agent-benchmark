    "Learners can apply three or more instructional design models (e.g., ADDIE, ARCS) suitable for science education environments according to situational needs",
    "Learners will select one or more trends (computational thinking or active learning) based on bibliometric analysis results (top 10% keywords in science education papers over three years) and submit a design plan incorporating the trend into a three-stage instructional design framework (objectives-activities-assessment).",
    "Learners design and implement cognitive load management strategies in multimedia and blended learning environments",
    "Trainees will design three types of assessment tools (quizzes, projects, discussions) for large-scale learners (100+ participants) in a blended learning environment (60% online + 40% offline) and submit a development report meeting four or more of five validity verification checklist items per tool."
