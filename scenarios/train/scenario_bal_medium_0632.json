  "learning_goals": [
    "Development of technical writing skills for predicting the thermal performance of dome structures in arid climate conditions using multivariate polynomial regression (MPR) models, with an emphasis on specialized vocabulary.",
    "Strengthening the ability to write reports analyzing and presenting energy efficiency simulation results of composite cladding systems (polycarbonate + aluminum) using parametric tools: integration of data visualization (charts/graphs) and technical language.",
    "By the end of the 1-week course, learners can verbally (including non-verbal expression) summarize an optimization design process considering both energy costs (electricity/fuel) and material costs (raw materials/waste disposal) in a given industrial case (e.g., battery manufacturing), propose three or more improvement measures (e.g., process efficiency, material substitution), and quantitatively compare and express cost-saving effects (at least 15%) using quantitative data.",
    "Cultivating the ability to document the results of applying an optimized hybrid cladding ratio (10% polycarbonate + 90% aluminum) in actual design cases as technical documentation, emphasizing accuracy in specialized vocabulary and technical report structure."
