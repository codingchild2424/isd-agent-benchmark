    "Using 3D visualization tools (e.g., GeoGebra 3D) on a metaverse platform (e.g., Gather.Town), learners will accurately represent five complex mathematical problems (matrix transformations, calculus geometry, etc.) in 3D modeling. They will achieve 80%+ completeness through peer feedback and instructor evaluation.",
    "Learners collaboratively solve real-world business cases with team members by applying a collective intelligence-based problem-solving process.",
    "Within one week, learners will systematically document problem-solving strategies for three math scenarios using an action-reflection-improvement template (1 page per section). They must receive a clarity score of 4+ (5-point scale) from two peer reviewers per document."
