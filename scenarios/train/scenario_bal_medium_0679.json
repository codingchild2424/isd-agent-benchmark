  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational mathematics knowledge (algebra, geometry, statistics) and basic proficiency in online learning tools, graph interpretation skills, and understanding of basic proof structures",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A mobile-based intensive short-term course for novice professionals in healthcare, legal, and technical fields, strengthening competencies for transitioning to online instruction. It supports the digital transformation of mathematics education, including data analysis, visualization, and proof processes, with a focus on calculation skills and graph interpretation required in actual work environments.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can design three or more instructional strategies (simulations, interactive graphs, step-by-step problem-solving) to effectively deliver mathematical concepts (e.g., equations, probability, statistics) in online classrooms and establish a conceptual explanation system including proof processes.",
    "Learners can produce two or more mobile-based microlearning materials (calculation practice apps, formula visualization videos, graph generation tools) applicable to practical settings.",
    "Within one week, learners can accept three or more peer feedbacks during a project-based assessment process, develop an improvement plan through a five-stage process (problem diagnosis-formula application-data analysis-result verification-optimization), and achieve an 'Excellent' grade in four out of five rubric items (creativity, accuracy, efficiency, expressiveness, collaboration). Statistical significance verification and graph interpretation skills are specifically evaluated during data analysis."
