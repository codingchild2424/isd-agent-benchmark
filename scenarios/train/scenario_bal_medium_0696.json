  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Design principles, basic software usage experience, and comprehension of secondary-level concepts in functions (linear/quadratic/exponential), geometry (planar/solid figures), and statistics (distributions/probability)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A practice-oriented course conducted in smartphone-centric, limited technological environments, focusing on the ability to visually represent mathematical concepts. Learners refine data analysis and graphing skills using mobile math tools, particularly visualizing function modeling, geometric transformations, and statistical reasoning processes.",
    "institution_type": "Graduate school",
    "learner_age": "In their 20s",
    "learner_education": "University",
    "learner_role": "Student",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Complete two graphic design projects visualizing middle school-level function, geometry, and statistics concepts using a mobile learning platform.",
    "Graduate learners can create three visual storytelling outputs (1 linear/quadratic function graph, 1 animated geometry model, 1 interactive statistical chart) from a given dataset within one week using Desmos or GeoGebra. They must submit deliverables achieving 4/5 points or higher in at least four of five peer evaluation rubric items (calculation accuracy, creative problem-solving, technical completeness, mathematical concept reflection, visual effectiveness).",
    "In PBL processes, learners can perform at least three rounds of mathematical design feedback while collaborating with peers and provide feedback on peers' graph interpretation and data analysis processes."
