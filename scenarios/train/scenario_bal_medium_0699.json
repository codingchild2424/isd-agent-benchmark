    "Through project-based assessment, learners will develop one digital learning module applicable to early childhood education institutions (ages 3–5), meeting the following criteria: (1) content aligned with developmental stages (sensorimotor, preoperational) approved by experts, (2) implementation of at least three interactive elements (touch-based exploration, voice feedback, virtual manipulation activities), (3) prototype submission reflecting institutional requirements (safety standards, operational environment) completed and demonstrated within two weeks",
    "Learners will measure three quantitative metrics (usage time, error rate, task completion rate) to analyze interaction effects of a tablet-based prototype, conduct two qualitative methods (5 user interviews, 3 observation records), and write a 10-page comprehensive report within four weeks meeting at least four of five rubric criteria"
