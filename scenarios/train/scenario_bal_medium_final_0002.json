  "title": "Biotech Virtual Laboratory: Designing Socio-Economic Linked Learning Based on Scientific Inquiry",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Life science fundamentals (cell structure, genetics concepts), basic molecular biology understanding (DNA replication, protein synthesis), interest in science-technology development within social contexts (technology-society interaction cases). General awareness of how historical/geographical backgrounds influence technology adoption",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Due to pandemic restrictions limiting in-person experiments, smartphone-based access is required. Inquiry-based learning centered on real-life applications of biotech advancements in healthcare (vaccine development), food (genetically modified crops), and energy (biofuels). Includes discussions on how technological progress impacts social systems (health insurance policies, food distribution systems) and civic rights (right to health, food sovereignty). Emphasizes a cultural geography approach comparing regional differences in technology adoption.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Using virtual lab simulations, learners explain PCR experiment procedures step-by-step and experience the scientific inquiry process, strengthening their ability to derive conclusions through experimental data and evidence analysis.",
    "Through inquiry-based learning activities, learners connect DNA replication mechanisms and biotech applications to socio-economic changes (e.g., improved healthcare access, strengthened food security) and analyze the impact of technological advancements on citizen rights and institutions.",
    "Applying scaffolding strategies, learners systematically analyze complex molecular biology concepts and predict how technological advancements affect social systems and citizen life in healthcare and energy. They explore cultural contexts of technology acceptance by comparing historical cases."
