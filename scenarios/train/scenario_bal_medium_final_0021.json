  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic agricultural management knowledge, fundamental smartphone app usage skills, foundational understanding of scientific experimental data interpretation (measurement, recording, inference), and awareness of variable control and evidence-based conclusion methodologies",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learners aim for advanced expertise in managing small-scale buffalo farms, focusing on developing field problem-solving skills using smart technologies. Conduct practice-centered projects in a BYOD environment, learning to analyze environmental data (temperature, humidity, pH) and buffalo biometric data collected via IoT sensors through scientific methods (observation/measurement/experimentation). Emphasizes data interpretation skills for evidence-based decision-making.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Applying the ADDIE model, learners will execute the agricultural management app design process step-by-step and establish a data collection system based on scientific inquiry principles (hypothesis formulation-experimentation-analysis-conclusion).",
    "Design digital system functionalities for record-keeping, health monitoring (biometric measurements and symptom analysis), and breeding management (genetic variable analysis and experimental design) in buffalo farms.",
    "Applying user-centered design principles (accessibility, intuitiveness, efficiency), learners will create an app interface prototype in Figma or Adobe XD that incorporates at least three farmer requirements and integrates real-time chart visualization of experimental data (e.g., crop growth patterns, soil analysis results).",
    "Over a 4-week intermediate course, learners will develop a farm management app prototype using agricultural IoT sensor data and implement at least three scientifically analyzable functions (data measurement/recording, pattern analysis/inference, result prediction/verification) applicable to real farm scenarios (e.g., irrigation system control, buffalo health monitoring). They will achieve scores of 80% or higher in at least two of three rubric categories (Functionality, Usability, Practical Applicability)."
