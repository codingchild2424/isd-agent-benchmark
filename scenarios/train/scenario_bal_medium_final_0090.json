    "Learners can observe physiological variables (blood pressure, respiratory rate, cardiac output, etc.) of virtual patients in computer simulations with ≥80% accuracy and select evidence-based diagnoses and interventions (e.g., medication, surgical procedures).",
    "Learners can perform emergency response protocols (CPR, airway management, etc.) with ≥70% success on mannequin simulations, systematically analyze experimental data (biometric signals, response times, etc.), and derive evidence-based conclusions.",
    "Learners can compare ≥3 advantages/disadvantages of LAMMPS and COMSOL simulation tools for molecular dynamics and fluid mechanics scenarios, select the appropriate tool based on evaluation criteria (accuracy ≥80%, computational efficiency <10 minutes, usability ≥4/5), and provide a 500±50-character rationale following the scientific inquiry method (problem definition–hypothesis–design–analysis–conclusion)."
