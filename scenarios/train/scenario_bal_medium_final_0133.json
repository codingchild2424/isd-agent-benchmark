  "title": "Workshop on Cell Biology Teaching Methods Using Blended Learning: Integration of Scientific Inquiry and Language Expression",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational biology knowledge (cell structure/functions), teaching experience (instructional design/classroom management), comprehension of scientific terminology (technical vocabulary/conceptual terms) and basic grammatical proficiency (academic writing/presentation)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "An activity-based blended learning program for pre-service/in-service teachers to enhance cell biology education competency. Aims to integrate scientific inquiry skills (experimental design/data analysis) with language expression (use of technical terms, procedural descriptions, reporting results), with a focus on improving academic writing (report/paper formats) and presentation skills (structured explanations/visual aids).",
    "institution_type": "Public/Non-profit educational institution",
    "learner_age": "In their 30s",
    "learner_education": "Adult learner (non-degree)",
    "learner_role": "Pre-service/In-service teacher",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Students can systematically explain core concepts of cell structure and function through the scientific inquiry process (hypothesis formulation, experimental design, data analysis, conclusion drawing) and linguistic expression (defining technical terms, describing experimental procedures, interpreting results).",
    "Students can design activity-based teaching methods in blended learning environments and apply language-integrated strategies (terminology organization, concept mapping, report writing) considering learners' reading, writing, and speaking abilities.",
    "Educators must structure the scientific inquiry process into a 3-stage instructional module (introduction-development-conclusion) within one week, develop teaching strategies applying at least two interaction techniques per stage (open-ended questioning, case-based analysis, term visualization, concept mapping), and obtain a score of 4 or higher (on a 5-point scale) in \"feasibility\" from at least two out of three peer reviewers."
