    "Learners will develop an organizational learning facilitation plan (including objectives, implementation steps, and evaluation metrics) applicable to real-world corporate environments (e.g., cross-team collaboration issues, new technology adoption cases) through a 3-week project-based assessment, submit it in the form of a 5-minute presentation and 3-page report, and achieve an 'Excellent' grade in 4 out of 5 rubric criteria."
