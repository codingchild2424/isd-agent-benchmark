    "Learners can analyze three or more educational AI platforms (e.g., Khan Academy, Duolingo) and propose two or more lesson design plans applicable to elementary school mathematics curriculum (fractions, equations, etc.) that meet at least 2 out of 3 points on a rubric evaluation criteria (clarity, feasibility, innovativeness).",
    "Learners can create visualized materials (images/videos) for three or more secondary mathematics concepts (functions, geometry, statistics, etc.) using generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, MidJourney, GeoGebra AI) and produce a report achieving a 'B' grade or higher in at least four out of five peer assessment rubric items.",
