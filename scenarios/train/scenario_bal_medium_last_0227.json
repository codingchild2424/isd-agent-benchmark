  "learning_goals": [
    "When designing science lessons, learners integrate technology, content, and language expression (grammar, vocabulary, text structure) using the seven knowledge domains of the TPACK framework.",
    "Learners develop at least three learning management, assessment, and communication strategies using smartphone-based tools (Canva, Quizlet, etc.), including optimization plans for scientific terminology and text expressions (readability enhancement, expressive power strengthening).",
    "Learners create a digital literacy self-assessment checklist and establish plans that consider clarity of scientific concept explanations (logical organization) and linguistic accessibility (learner-friendly expressions) when applying technology-integrated lesson plans."
