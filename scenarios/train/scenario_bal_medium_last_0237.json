    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners enhance learning motivation by ≥20% and strengthen cultural understanding as citizens using digital learning sheets linked to social studies history/culture exhibition content.",
    "Learners analyze application cases of the \"sensory exploration principle\" in digital learning sheets, apply them to social studies projects (e.g., local culture research, historical site visits), and write inquiry reports considering geographical and political contexts.",
    "Learners develop self-assessment checklists within one week that include ≥3 evaluation criteria (e.g., conceptual clarity, systematicity of research, data accuracy, cultural sensitivity) to measure cognitive (conceptual understanding) and psychomotor (field research) learning outcomes in social studies."
