  "learning_goals": [
    "Explain the fundamental principles of tensor-based regression learning and compare its differences from ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) in natural language processing, focusing on text structure and vocabulary usage.",
    "Solve simple regression problems in text data (e.g., word frequency prediction and contextual semantic analysis) by applying the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse calculation method for tensors.",
    "Understand the integration of Type-2 fuzzy sets into tensor regression models and apply them to address uncertainties in linguistic data (e.g., polysemy handling and context-dependent semantic interpretation)."
