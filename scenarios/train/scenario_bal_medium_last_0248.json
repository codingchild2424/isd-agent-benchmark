  "title": "Workshop on Designing and Developing Blended Language Education Curricula: Integrated Reading-Writing Strategies and Scientific Inquiry Methods",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of foundational educational theories and language teaching methodologies (e.g., communicative language teaching, content-based instruction), familiarity with basic grammatical terminology, and foundational competency in language learning data collection and analysis",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A language education curriculum development program focused on enhancing preservice/in-service teachers' blended learning design capabilities. It emphasizes vocabulary expansion and expression accuracy strategies for multicultural learners. Special attention is given to verifying and improving language learning effectiveness using scientific inquiry methods (observation, measurement, analysis).",
    "institution_type": "Public/Non-profit educational institution",
    "learner_age": "Teens (13-19)",
    "learner_education": "High school",
    "learner_role": "Pre-service/In-service teacher",
    "domain_expertise": "Beginner"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Design at least three optimized integration strategies for online-offline activities in blended learning models that reflect language acquisition theories (e.g., input hypothesis) and scientific inquiry methods, such as linking listening-speaking activities and evidence-based analysis.",
    "Develop at least one customized language education content (e.g., writing templates, reading comprehension worksheets, expressive diversity assessment tools) based on learner needs analysis (e.g., grammar proficiency, vocabulary size).",
    "Learners can collect data using formative assessment tools (three grammar quizzes, two expressive checklist observations) over a two-week blended learning period, then write a 500-word proposal including three improvement strategies (adjusting activity time, revising text difficulty, diversifying feedback methods) according to an evaluation rubric (grammar accuracy ≥80%, vocabulary diversity ≥10 items).",
    "Learners must submit one integrated lesson plan linking LMS (e.g., Google Classroom) and offline classes within two weeks, meeting the following criteria: 1) specify interactivity and analysis methods between digital/offline activities for language skills (reading-writing, listening-speaking), 2) include at least two learner engagement strategies (collaborative learning, role-playing), 3) present ≥3 evaluation rubric items (pronunciation, fluency, grammar, vocabulary) with observational data."
