  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will explain the scientific principles of dissolved oxygen (DO) control in wastewater treatment processes and its environmental management significance from a social responsibility perspective.",
    "Learners will understand the application principles of fuzzy logic and online Q-learning-based intelligent control methods, analyze them from a socio-technical system perspective, and link them to citizen participation.",
    "Learners analyze three DO (Dissolved Oxygen) concentration simulation cases within one week, prepare a report meeting at least two control performance evaluation metrics (accuracy ±5%, response time ≤30 seconds), propose sustainable environmental management strategies based on results, and explore community collaboration methods."
