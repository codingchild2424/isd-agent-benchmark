  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can represent the three pillars of sustainability (economic, environmental, social) using linear/nonlinear equations and design multivariate analysis models utilizing matrix operations.",
    "Within six months, learners can construct at least three multiple regression models to analyze the correlation between organizational learning mechanisms (knowledge-sharing frequency, training participation rates) and sustainability performance (energy efficiency improvement, carbon emission reduction), and submit a report verifying statistical significance at p-value < 0.05.",
    "Applying critical thinking, learners can validate corporate sustainability strategy improvements through differential equation-based simulations and derive feasible solutions using optimization algorithms."
