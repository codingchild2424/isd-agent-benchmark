  "title": "[Self-directed] Small-scale Conditioned Game Design Workshop for Soccer Tactical Training: Strengthening Social Collaboration and Spatial Strategy",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic soccer rules and techniques, experience in team sports, foundational knowledge of social interaction (teamwork, communication), and basic concepts of civic consciousness and respect for rights",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Training design methodology course reflecting real-game environments. Focuses on tactical adaptation to varying pitch sizes, with real-time digital data analysis for learning evaluation. Integrates team citizenship-building activities and historical case studies on sports' societal impact (Olympic values, community integration). Stresses culturally responsive design considering learners' backgrounds and institutional contexts.",

    "learner_education": "Adult learner (non-degree)",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Within one week, learners select ≥3 offensive/defensive tactics per soccer field size (small/medium/large) in simulation environments, create tactical execution plans meeting ≥4 of 5 evaluation criteria (positioning, spatial utilization, teamwork, communication, role allocation), and receive average feedback scores of ≥4/5 from 2 peer evaluators. This process strengthens civic consciousness and team dynamics management skills.",
    "Within one week, learners explain ≥3 conditional game design methods for optimizing spatial utilization (width and depth) within teams, present 1 applicable game design example for real work environments, and incorporate team dynamics management strategies considering cultural differences. Notably, they develop strategies reflecting sports’ social impact through historical case studies.",
    "Develop tactical training tasks tailored to skill levels (beginner vs. intermediate) and integrate activities that enhance learners’ social skills (leadership, conflict resolution, respect for rights). Apply inclusive approaches considering learners’ diverse backgrounds when designing educational curricula."
