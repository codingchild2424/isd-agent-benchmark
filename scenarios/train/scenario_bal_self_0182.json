  "title": "[Self-Directed] Designing Continuous Medical Education to Address Depression Treatment Gaps: Integrating Sociocultural Determinants",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic depression diagnosis and treatment protocols, experience with chronic disease management models, foundational cultural competency knowledge, basic awareness of social determinants of health",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Digital education program for healthcare professionals, designed with practical applicability to clinical settings. Includes case studies reflecting socioeconomic contexts (poverty/education gaps) and cultural diversity (language/religion/values) of local communities. Emphasizes educational strategies for health equity promotion, incorporating citizen engagement elements to explore community-based solutions.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners use a tool analyzing depression treatment gaps to propose at least three customized intervention strategies reflecting sociocultural determinants (ethnicity/race/class/regionality, etc.) of the target population.",
    "Learners successfully complete simulations at least twice, integrating cultural competence and social relationship elements into the six core components (e.g., self-management support, clinical information systems) of a chronic disease management model for depression treatment.",
    "Learners will analyze three real-world case studies on depression treatment through project-based assessments over six months, create and share two treatment improvement plans on a digital platform (Moodle or Notion), and achieve over 80% satisfaction in peer evaluations and expert feedback. This process incorporates analysis of health equity and social determinants (income, education, housing conditions, etc.)."
