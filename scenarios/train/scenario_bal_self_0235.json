  "title": "[Self-Directed] Virtual Reality-Based Language Learning Instructional Design for Students with Disabilities: Multisensory Integration Environment and Communication Skill Enhancement",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational knowledge in speech-language pathology and special education, minimum 3 years of special education field experience, understanding of language development stages and communication characteristics across disabilities (auditory/visual text processing, social interaction strategies), and VR-based educational tool experience",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Focused on developing customized language learning solutions applicable in the field using smartphone-based low-cost VR technology. It emphasizes a multisensory integration approach (combining visual, auditory, and tactile feedback) to improve reading comprehension (text analysis/inference skills) and expressive abilities (structuring/fluency) for students with disabilities. Communication skills are strengthened through social interaction simulations in VR environments.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will analyze 5 language-learning needs of students with disabilities (visual/auditory/physical) in VR environments (vocabulary expansion, grammar comprehension, expressive fluency, auditory/visual text processing, social interaction), design a draft evaluation framework addressing accessibility (text-to-speech, visual vocabulary reinforcement), interaction (voice commands/gesture recognition), and feedback (real-time grammar correction/pronunciation assessment) for each need, and achieve an 80%+ suitability score through peer review (3+ evaluators) and expert review (1+ evaluators) within a 6-month course.",
    "Learners will develop 3+ adaptive language teaching materials for smartphone-compatible VR tools: visual vocabulary cards with sign language integration for hearing-impaired students, voice-command-based grammar exercises with text-to-speech tools for physically impaired students, and auditory text conversion tools with 3D sound-based contextual comprehension activities for visually impaired students.",
    "Learners will implement 3+ VR language-learning scenarios (daily conversation simulations: role-play for expressive fluency training, sentence-construction games: grammar structure visualization with error feedback, cultural context understanding activities: multisensory text analysis) based on flexible instructional design principles (modified ADDIE model, situational learning theory), and write reports verifying learning effectiveness (15% vocabulary acquisition improvement, 10% grammar comprehension improvement, 4+/5 immersion survey scores) through user testing (20+ participants)."
