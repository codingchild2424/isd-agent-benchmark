  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic understanding of humanities and design concepts, academic writing (composition) and text analysis skills, and ability to apply basic grammar rules and vocabulary",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",

    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Most learners are at beginner levels in design/humanities, aiming for practical application. Digital tools (grammar checkers, collaboration platforms) are usable in a BYOD environment. Focuses on vocabulary expansion and refining expressions, especially emphasizing appropriate terminology and logical structuring for academic contexts.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Analyzing the physical and social meanings of everyday objects from an interdisciplinary perspective and explaining them linguistically (text/oral), with emphasis on design research terminology and culturally contextualized vocabulary.",
    "Learners select ≥3 design research cases, analyze their cultural contexts (historical background, social norms, regional characteristics, etc.), and write ~500-word critical thinking reports (with grammatical accuracy and logical coherence). They secure validity scores of ≥4/5 in peer review and instructor feedback, adhering to academic writing conventions.",
    "Comparing and applying research methodologies across disciplines (industrial design, anthropology, etc.), reconstructing them into linguistic frameworks (concept definition, terminology systematization). This enhances communication efficiency through interdisciplinary term integration and clear definitions."
