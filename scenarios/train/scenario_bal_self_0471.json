    "Within 6 months, learners complete 12 mobile-based language education modules (grammar analysis, vocabulary expansion, text interpretation, etc.) with ≥85% completion rate, strengthening language learning competencies through scientific inquiry methods (hypothesis formulation-observation-analysis-conclusion)",
    "Learners analyze language education materials (literary texts, argumentative essays, expository texts, etc.), achieve ≥90% accuracy in formative assessments on critical evaluation skills (contextual understanding, logical fallacy detection, evidence-based interpretation), and comparatively analyze expression strategies across text types",
    "Learners complete a 4-week project-based assignment (topic: designing language activities for elementary learners) and develop 1 applicable language instruction design plan for actual elementary/middle school settings. The design must include: (1) instructional-learning objectives (emphasizing reading comprehension, writing, and expression competencies), (2) activity structure (role-play, discussion, creative writing, etc.), (3) assessment methods (rubric-based performance evaluation), achieving ≥4.0 average on peer/professor evaluation criteria (5-point scale). Additionally, experimental design principles with controlled variables are applied to predict/evaluate educational effectiveness"
