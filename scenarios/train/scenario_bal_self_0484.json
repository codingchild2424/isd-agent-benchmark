  "title": "[Self-Directed] Enhancing Social Science Academic Writing Skills with Generative AI Support: Analyzing Civic Rights and Cultural Relationships",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic academic writing structures, smartphone proficiency, foundational knowledge of social science concepts (citizen rights, institutional analysis, cultural relations, historical contexts, etc.)",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "In technology-constrained environments, this course involves project-based learning applying generative AI tools to actual academic writing tasks via smartphones. Centering on social science research topics (e.g., community issues, policy analysis, cultural phenomena), it emphasizes critical thinking and academic rigor. Peer feedback strengthens social relationships and citizen participation competencies.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can systematically design at least three phases (planning-drafting-revision) of academic writing using generative AI tools and construct logical frameworks suitable for social science research topics (e.g., civil rights, institutional analysis, cultural relations)",
    "Learners can enhance critical analysis skills by applying evaluation criteria (five or more items including social context reflection, cultural validity, historical accuracy, institutional connectivity, civic engagement) to assess the academic suitability of AI-generated content",
    "Learners can establish three or more personalized writing strategies (time management and resource utilization) using AI tools in mobile environments (e.g., Notion, Grammarly), execute them with 80%+ weekly goal achievement over four weeks, and submit a portfolio at course completion analyzing implementation results and social impact (e.g., policy proposals, community problem-solving solutions)"
