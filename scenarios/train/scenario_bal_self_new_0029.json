  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will design and operate a PBL (problem-based learning) project in a 3D gamification environment for human resource development training, applying mathematical problem-solving skills (e.g., equation and graph interpretation).",
    "Using a 3D sandbox tool (e.g., Minecraft Education Edition), learners will design four math-based educational scenarios: spatial geometry (two 3D models: polyhedron volume calculation, coordinate system conversion), probability (one simulation: Monte Carlo method), and statistics (one data visualization: histogram and box plot). The project must achieve an 80% or higher fulfillment rate in peer evaluation and instructor feedback.",
    "Learners will evaluate learning outcome metrics (PE, EE, SI, FC) using mathematical analysis methods (mean, standard deviation, correlation analysis) to improve educational satisfaction by 20% or more."
