  "title": "[Self-Directed] Blended 5E Learning Model Workshop for Enhancing Integrated Science-Language Instructional Competencies: Integrating Scientific Inquiry and Language Expression",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic scientific concepts, interest in educational experiences, foundational ability to articulate scientific content in specialized terminology (grammar structures, vocabulary usage), and experience in reflective journaling",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Program for professionals in medical/legal/technical fields needing science-integrated instructional design competencies. Operates in smartphone-centric limited-technology environments, focusing on tasks converting scientific concepts into professional jargon (e.g., medical procedure manuals, technical reports). Utilizes real-world cases linked to learners' job contexts.",
    "institution_type": "Graduate school",
    "learner_age": "In their 30s",
    "learner_education": "High school",
    "learner_role": "Student",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "For science-integrated subject instructional design, learners will explain how to apply the 5E learning model’s phase-specific strategies and systematically connect the scientific inquiry process (hypothesis formulation–experimentation–analysis–conclusion) to language activities (observation recording, argumentation, report writing).",
    "In blended learning environments, learners will design integrated online (virtual lab discussions) and offline (field observation journals) activities to enhance engagement, and develop tasks (e.g., patient education materials) that translate scientific concepts (e.g., ecosystem interactions) into specialized domain-specific language (medical/legal terminology).",
    "During a two-week mid-term course, learners will write reflective learning journals three times weekly, incorporate at least two feedbacks from peers/instructors, and submit a revised learning plan. This includes reconstructing scientific content (e.g., cell division processes) into clear domain-specific expressions (e.g., legal document format)."
