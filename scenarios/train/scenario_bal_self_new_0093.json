  "title": "[Self-Directed] Functional Game-Based Language-Motor Integration Training Course for Female Cricket Athletes’ Talent Development: Enhancing Communication Strategies and Expressiveness",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Proficiency in basic cricket rules and techniques, foundational sports science knowledge, core game-related vocabulary and communication skills, and basic writing and reading comprehension abilities.",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A digital portfolio system that records and reflects on training processes linguistically, alongside real-time feedback and analysis enhancement using digital devices. Particularly evaluates learners’ expressive abilities, vocabulary, and communication strategies systematically through speech transcription data and text analysis.",
    "institution_type": "Graduate school",
    "learner_age": "In their 20s",
    "learner_education": "University",
    "learner_role": "Student",
    "domain_expertise": "Advanced"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Through functional game scenarios, learners can improve the application accuracy of core cricket skills (bowling, batting, fielding) to ≥85% and enhance language skills using advanced vocabulary (e.g., 'slip field', 'sweep shot') and grammatical structures for strategic team communication.",
    "In gender-integrated training environments, learners can apply acquired skills (e.g., situational judgment, communication strategies) with ≥80% accuracy in two or more of three real-game simulations. They can record/transcribe five coaching instructions and five peer feedback instances during matches, classify interactions by type (imperative, negotiation, encouragement), and write reports applying text analysis techniques.",
    "Learners can design personalized talent development roadmaps, setting three or more long-term growth goals (3/6 months) and developing writing skills (e.g., descriptive expression, reflective journaling) and linguistic proficiency for systematic documentation of goal achievement."
