  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational mathematics knowledge, basic understanding of pedagogy, and elementary comprehension of classroom social interactions and cooperative learning strategies. Additionally, familiarity with socioconstructivist learning theory and diverse learner types (individual/group)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course intensively training fluency-enhancing strategies applicable in mathematics education settings for pre-service/in-service teachers. Particularly emphasizes collaborative learning models, feedback mechanisms based on social constructivist learning theory, and lesson design considering diverse learner types (individual/group, cultural backgrounds). Aims to build an educational environment fostering learners' citizenship awareness and social responsibility.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Within two weeks, learners can develop an activity plan to enhance fluency in math components (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) by considering speed (15 problems per minute), accuracy (≥90%), and persistence (≥3 practice sessions per week). They can receive peer feedback rated ≥4 out of 5 on a rubric, strengthening social interaction and collaborative problem-solving skills.",
    "Learners can measure fluency improvement effects using math skill assessment tools and develop differentiated strategies to address diverse learner needs (individual/group) in classrooms, including culturally responsive approaches that consider cultural backgrounds and social relationships.",
    "Learners can apply learned strategies to design lesson plans that strengthen students' mathematical endurance and stability. They can explore collaborative learning activities to simultaneously enhance social skills (communication, conflict resolution) and mathematical thinking (critical analysis, creative problem-solving)."
