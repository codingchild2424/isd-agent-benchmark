    "Generate documentation with a 3:1 text:code ratio following literate programming principles",
    "Perform preprocessing and visualization of satellite observation data using modularized functions",
    "Within the first three months of a six-month course, learners apply Earth Observation (EO) data to an air pollution analysis project, analyze at least three satellite images, build a pollution concentration prediction model (linear regression), and submit a final report meeting at least four out of five evaluation rubric criteria (including ≥80% accuracy)."
