  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational educational theory, secondary education field experience, understanding of language learning theories (integrated approaches to listening, speaking, reading, writing and strategies linking grammar, vocabulary, comprehension, and expression), and digital tool proficiency",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course for pre-service educators in medical, legal, and technical fields to develop competency in designing learner-tailored environments within language education contexts (grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, expression). The focus is on developing language learning strategies applicable to actual school settings, with an emphasis on empirical approaches using text-based analysis tools and expressive evaluation modules.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Design a language learning environment incorporating six dimensions of an educational leadership model (protecting instructional time, maintaining high visibility, providing teacher incentives, promoting professional development, motivating learning, setting high expectations), including integrated grammar/vocabulary/reading/expression strategies and customized activities based on text analysis.",
    "Learners analyze learner characteristics (language proficiency, learning styles, interests) via PBL (Problem-Based Learning), develop a personalized language learning prototype (with ≥3 features: vocabulary quiz system, text analysis tool, expressive proficiency assessment module) within six months, and achieve ≥80/100 in peer and instructor evaluations. The prototype focuses on improving writing feedback and reading comprehension.",
    "Learners design three language learning management strategies for smartphone environments (time-block learning, vocabulary flashcards, writing feedback system), apply them ≥3 times weekly for four weeks, submit learning journals (tracking time management, content utilization, performance metrics), and propose improvements based on peer feedback and instructor input. Journals document progress in listening, speaking, reading, and writing."
