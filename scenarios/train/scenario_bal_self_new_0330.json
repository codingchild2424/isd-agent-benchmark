    "Learners will design personalized training scenarios using VR systems and develop strategic communication skills (speaking, listening, feedback) in sports contexts.",
    "Based on ecological dynamics theory, learners will articulate real-time decision-making and team collaboration strategies in response to environmental changes through verbal expressions (presentations, discussions, explanations).",
    "Learners will explore three or more scenarios (e.g., virtual city design, environmental problem-solving) in VR and game-based platforms, derive two creative problem-solving strategies, and apply them to a real project (school environment improvement plan). Teachers will assign \"excellent\" ratings in four or more of the five rubric criteria (creativity, feasibility, collaboration, expression, listening). In sports-related scenarios, learners will demonstrate ≥80% clarity in expression (pronunciation, intonation, vocabulary choice) during 3-minute presentations and ≥5 reactive listening techniques (nodding, summarizing, questioning)."
