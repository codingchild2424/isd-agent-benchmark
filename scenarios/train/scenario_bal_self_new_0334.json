  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic knowledge of pedagogy, understanding of elementary education curricula, and foundational grasp of scientific inquiry methods (observation, hypothesis formulation, variable control, experimental design, data analysis, evidence-based conclusions).",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A blended learning course combining field practice with complex adaptive systems in mobile learning environments using personal devices. It provides a project-based learning environment where real-world educational problems are solved through scientific inquiry processes (problem definition-hypothesis formulation-variable control-data collection-analysis-conclusion). Emphasis is on applying scientific methodologies (observation records, experimental design, data analysis, evidence-based practice) in educational settings.",

    "Preservice elementary teachers can create individualized education plans (IEPs) based on the scientific inquiry process (observation-hypothesis-variable control-experiment-analysis-conclusion) for three or more students with special education needs during 13-week field practicums, record variable control observations and reflective journals twice weekly, and demonstrate special education support competencies by receiving average scores of 4+ on a 5-point scale from supervising teachers.",
    "Preservice elementary teachers can enhance self-efficacy in flexibly responding to diverse educational situations by applying complex adaptive system design principles and the scientific inquiry process (observation-hypothesis-experiment-analysis-conclusion), and strengthen their ability to derive evidence-based conclusions.",
    "Preservice elementary teachers can perform weekly self-assessments and feedback management through case-based learning modules provided by mobile microlearning platforms, strengthening their evidence-based practice and data analysis competencies in educational settings."
