  "title": "Language-Integrated Dynamic Learning Design for Entrepreneurship Development in Engineering Education: Strengthening Creative Expression and Technical Communication",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic engineering knowledge and practical experience, foundational project management, technical documentation and presentation skills, and comprehension of basic structures and expression techniques in business texts",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Strengthening innovative problem-solving competencies that integrate entrepreneurial mindset and engineering knowledge for practicing professionals. Special emphasis is placed on technical communication clarity (terminology usage, sentence structure) and persuasive business proposal text organization (problem definition, solution presentation, value demonstration). Language skill enhancement activities like vocabulary expansion, context analysis, and expression refinement are integrated into the learning process.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Using design thinking processes and creative expression strategies (metaphor, storytelling, visual rhetoric), learners will propose two or more linguistic and visual solutions to engineering problems",
    "Through activity-based team projects, learners will identify real-world industrial problems and concretize core values of business models through linguistic and text-based approaches (keyword extraction, logical structuring, persuasive expression)",
    "According to Bloom's taxonomy analysis, evaluation, and creation stages, learners will select technology-based startup ideas, derive three improvement plans reflecting linguistic feedback (grammatical accuracy, logical consistency, rhetorical techniques) for each idea, and submit improved proposals achieving 'excellent' ratings in at least two of three peer evaluation rubric criteria (creativity, feasibility, social impact)"
