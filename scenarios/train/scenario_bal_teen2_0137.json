  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners analyze uncertainties in marine work environments using fuzzy set theory and develop crisis response strategies considering citizens’ safety rights within social networks.",
    "Using axiomatic design methodology, learners derive systems for marine safety protocols that account for functional requirements, citizens’ safety rights, and community collaboration frameworks.",
    "Through virtual simulations, learners perform decision-making processes during marine emergencies with ≥90% accuracy and propose response plans incorporating community collaboration and citizen participation."
