    "prior_knowledge": "Basic scientific knowledge and general understanding of special education",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Students engage in web-based experiential learning using individual devices, while in-person sessions focus on project feedback and collaborative learning. They explore online content design methods reflecting the needs of special education students with diverse cognitive styles",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Design web-based experiential learning modules that consider the cognitive styles of students with special educational needs",
    "Diagnose learners' comprehension levels using data analysis techniques and provide personalized feedback",
    "Apply accessibility enhancement strategies (e.g., visual/hearing support) to science-integrated experiential activities",
    "Over three weeks, learners submit a prototype or 10-page report (reflecting ≥5 peer/instructor feedbacks) through project-based assessment (3 design-verify-improve cycles) and propose three specific improvement strategies."
