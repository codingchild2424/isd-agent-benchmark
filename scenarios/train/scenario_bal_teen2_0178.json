  "title": "Designing Blended Learning Environments in Business Administration: Flipped Learning-Based Strategies to Strengthen Social Studies Civic Competencies and Understanding of Economic Systems",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational business administration theories (market structures, corporate ethics), social studies curriculum design principles (civic competency development, critical thinking), basic understanding of civic rights and economic systems (interaction between democracy and capitalism), and introductory global economic relations analysis",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A practical instructional design competency enhancement program for pre-service and in-service teachers. The course emphasizes cultivating core social studies competencies (citizenship, critical thinking, decision-making skills) through business education, particularly addressing the historical development and modern applications of political/economic systems. It highlights project-based learning (PBL) approaches for solving community issues.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Propose at least three instructional design frameworks applying flipped learning-based blended models to business administration and social studies education, each incorporating analysis of relationships between civic rights and economic institutions while exploring decision-making processes in political-economic contexts",
    "Within a 3-week graduate mid-term course, learners will design two or more specific integration strategies linking online pre-learning materials (videos, readings) with offline activities (discussions, projects) for each of three designated learning objectives (corporate ethics, market structure analysis, global economic relations), achieve over 80% suitability through peer evaluation, with each strategy reflecting cultural diversity and civic engagement elements",
    "Design two or more formative assessment interactions (role-plays, case analyses, simulated policy debates) to foster learner engagement, each exploring relationships between social responsibility and economic decision-making while analyzing institutional changes through historical case comparisons"
