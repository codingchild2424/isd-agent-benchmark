    "Learners can create a 10-minute presentation incorporating ≥3 tiers of visual aids (images, charts, videos) using multimedia authoring tools (Canva or PowerPoint) to effectively convey social studies content (e.g., local issues, historical events).",
    "Learners can select ≥3 science phenomena (e.g., ecosystem changes, physical motion) using modeling software (PhET or NetLogo), design a ≥3-step simulation-based lesson plan, and score ≥4/5 on a rubric (clarity of objectives, activity diversity, assessment system).",
    "Learners can select 3 inquiry-based teaching methods (e.g., digital resource problem-solving, online collaboration tools, AI simulations) suitable for technology-integrated classes over a 3-week midterm, apply each to real-class scenarios, and draft lesson plans (including learning objectives, activity design, assessment criteria) achieving an average ≥4/5 on peer/teacher rubrics."
