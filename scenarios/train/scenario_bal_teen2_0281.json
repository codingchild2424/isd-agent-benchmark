  "title": "Workshop on Generative AI-Enhanced Bilingual Scientific Inquiry Education Design for K-12: AI Integration Strategies to Strengthen the Scientific Inquiry Process",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational bilingual education knowledge, understanding of science curriculum content (experimental design, scientific methodology), mobile device proficiency, comprehension of basic scientific terminology (variables, hypotheses, observation, measurement, analysis, conclusions), and familiarity with fundamental scientific inquiry processes",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Developing strategies for utilizing generative AI tools to strengthen bilingual education in science: exploring AI-supported solutions to overcome language barriers in the scientific inquiry process (observation→hypothesis→experiment→analysis→conclusion). Special emphasis is placed on integrating AI tools for variable control and evidence-based analysis.",
    "institution_type": "Vocational training institution",
    "learner_age": "Teens (13-19)",
    "learner_education": "Adult learner (non-degree)",
    "learner_role": "Professional (medical/legal/technical)",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Design strategies for integrating generative AI tools (text generators, visual design tools, feedback systems) into bilingual science inquiry classes: enhancing scientific inquiry activities including hypothesis formulation, independent/dependent variable control, and experimental data analysis.",
    "Possess the ability to create mobile-friendly microlearning content: integrating scientific learning elements (scientific observation documentation, experimental procedure visualization, data graph generation) and supporting evidence-based conclusions.",
    "Within one week, learners complete three bilingual (Korean-English) science tasks (e.g., lab report writing, scientific terminology translation, hypothesis verification analysis) using AI-based assessment rubrics, achieving over 70% scores in each of the five rubric criteria (accuracy, creativity, linguistic fluency, scientific evidence utilization, conclusion validity)."
