  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational medical knowledge and understanding of primary care procedures, basic proficiency in scientific methodologies (experimental design, data analysis, variable control), literature analysis skills for evidence-based approaches.",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Project-based learning utilizing digital devices, focusing on integrating transgender health knowledge with existing medical systems. Emphasizes scientific inquiry (observation, measurement, analysis) in the learning process and improving medical protocols through evidence-based approaches. Particularly systematizes the process of verifying hypotheses and drawing conclusions using data collection and analysis tools.",
    "institution_type": "Vocational training institution",
    "learner_age": "Teens (13-19)",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Enhancing the ability to develop treatment plans reflecting physiological and psychological characteristics of transgender and non-binary patients: Applying scientific observation, evidence-based analysis, and variable control methodologies.",
    "Developing case-based problem-solving skills integrating transgender health knowledge into existing medical protocols: Improving protocols using hypothesis verification and data analysis methodologies.",
    "Learners will write two or more communication scenarios considering cultural contexts using three or more scientific inquiry methods (e.g., literature analysis, case studies, interviews) to respect the rights of transgender patients in multicultural environments and achieve an average of 4 points or higher on a peer evaluation rubric (clarity, cultural sensitivity, scientific basis) on a 5-point scale. The effectiveness will be verified using measurable indicators and analytical tools."
