  "title": "[K-12] CMS Utilization Strategies in Remote Education: Instructional Design Principles for Enhancing Social Interaction",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic online learning platform usage experience, understanding of instructional design principles, foundational knowledge of social interaction and collaborative learning, and awareness of diverse cultural backgrounds",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Emphasizes competency in smartphone-based CMS utilization within limited technological environments. Particularly focuses on accessibility improvement strategies to bridge the digital divide and inclusive instructional design reflecting diverse learner needs. Specialized in educational resource allocation considering historical/geographical constraints and designing citizen-participatory learning activities.",
    "institution_type": "Graduate school",
    "learner_age": "In their 20s",
    "learner_education": "University",
    "learner_role": "Pre-service/In-service teacher",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can explain strategies for building a social learning environment to foster citizenship by mapping Chickering and Gamson’s seven principles of good practice to CMS functionalities.",
    "Learners can design three types of digital learning materials (e.g., videos, quizzes, infographics) tailored to learner profiles (age, level, interests) using content repurposing possibilities and propose solutions that meet four or more of the five expert review criteria: suitability, creativity, practicality, and social relevance.",
    "Learners can establish a 2–4-week collaborative learning activity plan (three stages: goal setting → activity design → feedback incorporation) using interaction reconstruction tools (e.g., Padlet, Miro) in a multicultural cooperative learning environment and achieve over 80% suitability through peer evaluations and instructor verification, thereby strengthening collaborative problem-solving competencies as citizens.",
    "Learners can explain methods for flexibly structuring curricula through modular design and apply inclusive educational design considering diverse cultural backgrounds.",
    "Learners must integrate formative assessment data into a CMS analytics tool (e.g., Google Analytics, LMS-built-in analyzer) within two weeks, establish an automated feedback system with ≥80% accuracy, apply it to peer evaluation reports of three learners, and propose data-driven educational improvement strategies."
