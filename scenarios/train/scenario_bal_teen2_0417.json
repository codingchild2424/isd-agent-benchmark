  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic mobile device usage and understanding of social media platforms, foundational grammar/vocabulary knowledge, basic reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills, ability to analyze simple texts, and experience with collaborative tools",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Students perform language learning activities using personal devices, collaborating and sharing content via social media. Focuses on acquiring field-applicable communication skills (grammar accuracy, expression, specialized terminology) as job seekers. Particularly aims to cultivate effective language expression abilities in global contexts. The program holistically enhances critical thinking, creative problem-solving, and digital literacy.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will select 3 language-learning contents from mobile social media (WeChat, Instagram) and analyze their text structure, vocabulary, and grammatical accuracy using scientific inquiry methods (hypothesis-observation-analysis-conclusion). They will write a 500-character critical report (clarity, logic, creativity, practicality) and achieve ≥B+ (85+) in ≥3 of 4 rubric criteria.",
    "Learners will design an integrated reading-writing language education case using mobile social media (Instagram, TikTok) via case studies and qualitative methods (interviews, observations). After 2 weeks, they will achieve ≥4.0 average satisfaction in learner response surveys (5 items, 5-point Likert scale), with the case contributing to improved reading comprehension and creative expression.",
    "Over 2 weeks, learners will design 3 integrated speaking-listening activities using mobile social media platforms (Facebook Groups, Padlet) with real-time feedback and collaboration tools. Activities must achieve ≥4.0 (5-point scale) in ≥4 of 5 criteria (interactivity, engagement, creativity, expression, grammatical accuracy) in peer evaluations and instructor feedback, emphasizing technical terminology and global communication skills."
