  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic statistical analysis and research methodology understanding, familiarity with fundamental educational technology concepts, basic comprehension of language assessment tools (reading/writing tests, vocabulary tests, etc.), and text data processing experience.",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "An environment enabling access to smartphone-based language learning materials and simple statistical practice tools, including text analysis (word frequency, grammatical structure) and language data visualization (reading comprehension trends, expressive ability distribution). It supports integration with a database of K-12 learner language intervention cases.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can analyze and explain causal relationships between measurement errors and latent variables (e.g., reading comprehension, expressive ability, lexical fluency) in language education technology experiment data using SEM.",
    "Learners can structure a research design in three stages (problem definition, variable setting, model verification) to analyze the mediating effects of a language intervention program on vocabulary acquisition and grammatical understanding using SEM within four weeks and write a report receiving an average of 4 or higher on the \"research design validity\" item (5-point scale) from two peer reviewers.",
    "Learners can compare differences between traditional experimental designs (MANCOVA) and SEM-based approaches to select appropriate analysis methods for language education data (e.g., text analysis results, assessment scores)."
