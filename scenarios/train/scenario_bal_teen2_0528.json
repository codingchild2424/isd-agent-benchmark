  "learning_goals": [
    "Explain three elements to consider in mobile language learning design based on the FRAME model and TDT theory: context-based grammar integration, situation-specific vocabulary enhancement, and multimodal text interaction",
    "Develop three or more language learning assessment tools applicable in smartphone environments (writing analysis apps, pronunciation evaluation AI tools, real-time grammar checkers)",
    "Within one week, learners will propose two or more methods to apply personalized feedback systems (e.g., ChatGPT-based real-time expression feedback) and gamification (e.g., point/badge systems) to digital portfolios or language exchange platforms in mobile language learning design, and achieve 'excellent' ratings in at least two of three peer evaluation rubric criteria (creativity, feasibility, effectiveness)"
