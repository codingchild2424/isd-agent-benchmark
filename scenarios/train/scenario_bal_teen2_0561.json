  "title": "[K-12] Language-Integrated Practice-Based Instructional Design Course for Prospective Computer Science Teachers: Strengthening Text, Visual, and Expression Strategies",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Core computer science theory and programming language proficiency, foundational grammar comprehension and text structuring skills for educational content design. Additionally requires vocabulary selection abilities tailored to learner levels and experience with visual representation tools",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Emphasizes the design and execution of simulated lessons for solving real-life problems. Special focus is placed on effectively conveying complex concepts through vocabulary selection appropriate to learners' levels, clear text structuring, and the use of visual expression tools. The process includes systematic evaluation of linguistic elements such as grammatical accuracy, logical flow, and lexical appropriateness.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Over six months, learners systematically design three computer science topics (e.g., sorting algorithms, variable usage, conditional statements) in real classroom settings, develop educational materials (1 text explanation document, 1 visual representation tool), and achieve ≥80% satisfaction in peer and instructor feedback. Emphasis is placed on grammatical accuracy and vocabulary appropriateness in text structuring.",
    "Learners maintain weekly reflection journals over six months, analyze ≥3 language acquisition patterns (e.g., grammar error types, vocabulary expansion speed, expressive fluency), and develop/implement two personalized expression strategies (e.g., error-correction feedback system, vocabulary expansion activities).",
    "Collaborating with two peer teachers, learners develop ≥3 educational materials (grammar worksheets, logical flow evaluation tables, vocabulary selection guidelines) and write evaluation reports integrating linguistic elements (grammar accuracy ≥90%, logical flow meeting 4-level criteria, vocabulary appropriateness checklist). Text-based and visual expression evaluation criteria are applied in parallel.",
    "Over six months, learners analyze ≥10 text types (manuals, reports, emails) in corporate contexts and design ≥5 effective knowledge-transfer systems using multimodal expressions (visuals, diagrams, tables). Emphasis is placed on text simplification and visual representation strategies for complex concepts."
