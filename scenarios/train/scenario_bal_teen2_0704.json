    "Learners can collect data from three or more online learning sessions using a four-dimensional (behavioral, cognitive, emotional, social) measurement tool, apply two or more analysis techniques (e.g., mean comparison, correlation analysis) to the collected data, and create a visualized report.",
    "Development of competency in analyzing causal relationships between learning engagement factors and motivation using structural equation modeling (SEM).",
    "Over 1–6 months, learners can analyze three or more learner characteristics (age, learning style, technology accessibility), propose two or more value co-creation strategies (e.g., digital portfolio sharing, local problem-solving projects) through collaboration with stakeholders (teachers, peers, local communities) when designing online science projects, and produce actionable plans.",
    "Learners can analyze formative assessment data (e.g., quiz accuracy rates, video completion rates) to propose three or more specific improvements for online learning environments (e.g., content restructuring, feedback system implementation) and achieve over 80% suitability through peer evaluation and instructor validation."
