  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will improve complex grammar structure and text analysis skills by 30% or more through a flipped learning model and strengthen context-specific vocabulary application abilities.",
    "Learners will enhance oral presentation and document-based communication engagement by 40% or more through peer feedback activities and acquire critical feedback skills.",
    "Learners will improve vocabulary expansion, grammar application, and reading comprehension test scores by 25% or more through weekly formative and summative assessments and build learning portfolios.",
    "Learners will perform O-PIRTAS model-based activities (summarizing, testing, projects) three or more times weekly and achieve 4.0 or higher on a 5-point Likert self-directed learning habit scale at the end of a six-month course, along with submitting a learning strategy report."
