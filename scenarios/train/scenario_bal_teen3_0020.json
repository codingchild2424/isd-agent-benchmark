  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic problem-solving methodologies, language domain knowledge (grammar, text structure, argument analysis, vocabulary application), foundational critical thinking, and basic understanding of diverse genres (expository, persuasive, literary texts)",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Case-based learning in smartphone-limited environments, focusing on language skills (text analysis, argumentation, vocabulary). Emphasizes efficient reading strategies and systematic expression techniques for small screens.",
    "institution_type": "Graduate school",
    "learner_age": "In their 20s",
    "learner_education": "University",
    "learner_role": "Student",
    "domain_expertise": "Beginner"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners analyze success and failure cases to solve complex language problems (e.g., text interpretation, argument structure analysis) and apply these to similar problems. They develop case-based reasoning skills considering linguistic features across genres (explanatory texts, argumentative essays, literary texts).",
    "Learners construct multidimensional arguments (initial claim, counterargument, rebuttal) for given language problems (e.g., argumentative texts) to develop logical reasoning. They strategically consider vocabulary selection, sentence structure, and logical connectors.",
    "Based on lessons from failure cases (e.g., inconsistent arguments, vocabulary misuse, context neglect), learners creatively propose new language problem-solving strategies (e.g., critical reading, systematic expression, meta-language analysis)."
