    "Within six months, learners complete 12 mobile-based language education modules (covering grammar, vocabulary, reading, writing) with ≥85% completion rate, acquiring advanced vocabulary utilization and complex sentence structure analysis skills",
    "Learners analyze the structure and content of language education materials (texts, multimedia), achieve 90% accuracy in formative assessments of critical evaluation skills, and enhance cross-text comparative analysis and contextual meaning inference abilities",
    "Over a 1–6-month long-term course, learners develop one language instruction design applicable to real educational settings (elementary or secondary) through project-based tasks. The design must include three mandatory elements: instructional objectives (strengthening grammar, reading, expressive competencies), activity structure (integrated reading-writing activities and creative expression tasks), and assessment methods (portfolio, rubric, self-assessment), achieving ≥80% fulfillment rate in peer and instructor evaluation rubrics"
