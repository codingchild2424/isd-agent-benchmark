    "In a VR simulation environment (e.g., Unity-based physics simulation), learners will solve three real-world problems (e.g., bridge design, population growth prediction) through mathematical modeling. They will demonstrate the modeling process (variable definition, equation setup, validation) step-by-step and submit deliverables meeting peer and instructor evaluation criteria (4+ out of 5).",
    "Learners can document a process of improving their problem-solving strategies three or more times based on peer coaching feedback."
