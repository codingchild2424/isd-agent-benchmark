  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic business terminology, experience with online learning tools, and foundational understanding of socio-economic contexts (history, geography, institutions, relationships)",

    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Strengthening the Ability to Utilize Online Libraries and Curricula in Smartphone-Centric, Resource-Limited Technical Environments. Particularly emphasizing improved accessibility to bridge the digital divide and developing business competencies responsive to economic and political changes (policies, global market trends). Learners recognize their rights and responsibilities as citizens and establish business strategies considering diverse cultural backgrounds",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will engage in a PBL task based on real-world business scenarios (e.g., virtual startup operation) over one week, utilizing at least three types of resources (articles, statistics, videos) from an online library to explain problem-solving strategies through a 5-step process. They must achieve a score of 4 or higher (out of 5) in at least four of the five peer assessment rubric criteria (creativity, feasibility, collaboration, analytical skills, execution). This process enhances decision-making abilities considering the influence of economic systems and market structures.",
    "Learners will evaluate core elements of business content delivery (structure, clarity, engagement) using an online curriculum accessible via mobile environments. They will analyze the impact of economic and political factors (e.g., policy changes, global trade) on business decision-making and cultivate economic responsibility as citizens.",
    "Learners will produce project deliverables integrating and applying business education materials via mobile devices, even in limited technological environments. They will propose sustainable business models considering interactions between local communities and global markets (culture, institutions, relationships), exploring strategies that simultaneously achieve social value and economic efficiency."
