  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic language proficiency (reading, writing, speaking, listening), cross-cultural communication experience, understanding of basic grammar, and exposure to various text types (explanatory, dialogic, epistolary, etc.)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course focused on cross-cultural communication scenario analysis and practice in offline classrooms using digital devices. Includes diverse text-based activities (reading comprehension, writing, vocabulary games) to expand learners' vocabulary and expressive abilities, with intensive exploration of culturally contextualized language use cases.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can interpret linguistic and behavioral contexts in cross-cultural situations (e.g., mask-wearing practices) from an interpretive perspective and assess their ability to identify implicit meanings and cultural implications in texts.",
    "Learners can mediate cultural interpretation differences among peers three or more times in a 2–4 week classroom interaction simulation and demonstrate adjustment skills meeting at least four of five evaluation rubric items (e.g., active listening, empathetic expression, clarity of suggestions, vocabulary diversity, non-verbal communication).",
    "Learners can develop two or more language activity modules reflecting interpretive approaches (e.g., role-playing, text analysis, cultural comparison writing) during the instructional design phase, integrating vocabulary expansion and expressive skill enhancement elements into each module."
