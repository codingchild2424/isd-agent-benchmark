  "title": "[K-12] Blended Instructional Design for Collaborative Learning and Educational Language Modeling: Enhancing Argumentation, Expression, and Reading Comprehension Competencies",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic digital tool proficiency, foundational understanding of language learning (grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, and text structure analysis), and collaborative learning experience (including team-based argumentation activities)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Course focusing on acquiring collaborative learning strategies and language modeling techniques immediately applicable in professional settings. Centers on activity design to improve K-12 learners' expressive skills (speaking/writing) and reading comprehension (reading/analysis). Includes verified cases for immediate classroom application (text restructuring, argument evaluation).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners design and implement team-based argumentation activities using the Collaborative Instructional Framework (CIF), enhancing logical expression (text-based argument construction) and critical reading skills (analysis of diverse perspectives in texts)",
    "Learners use the MoCAS tool to produce: 1) an integrated text (≥500 characters, reading-writing-grammar integration) on three topics (e.g., environment, technology, culture) in online/offline settings; 2) a 3-minute+ presentation video (speaking/expression evaluation); and 3) achieve ≥4 points per category (≥9/12 total) in peer assessment rubrics (clarity, logic, creativity)",
    "Learners identify three language tasks (text analysis, argument evaluation, creative reconstruction) corresponding to Bloom’s Taxonomy’s analytical level (analysis, evaluation, creation), select educational language models (keyword mapping, sentence expansion, text restructuring) for each task type, and apply them to ≥2 K-12 lesson scenarios"
