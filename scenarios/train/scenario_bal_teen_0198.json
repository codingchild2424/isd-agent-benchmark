  "title": "[K-12] Constructivist Collaborative Learning for Integrated High School Mathematics and Engineering Education Design Project: Integration of Formulas, Graphs, and Proofs",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Mastery of core mathematics concepts (algebra, geometry, statistics) and instructional methodologies, knowledge of high school curriculum structures, graph interpretation and formula manipulation skills, and foundational calculus and geometric proof experience",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course where pre-service and in-service teachers internalize constructivist approaches and collaborative learning strategies for designing integrated mathematics-technology curricula in high schools. Focuses on strengthening problem-solving and proof skills through project-based learning, with particular emphasis on developing core mathematical competencies such as formula derivation, graph interpretation, and measurement accuracy.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can design a 3-session curriculum integrating high school mathematics (geometry, calculus) equations, formulas, graphs, and engineering (structural design, physics simulations) using VR and multimedia tools (GeoGebra, Unity), achieving an average of 4 or higher on a 5-point scale in peer reviews and expert evaluations.",
    "Learners can select three historical technological advancements in mathematics (e.g., pi calculation methods, coordinate system evolution, calculus applications), develop an 8–12-page PPT or activity sheet analyzing their connections to science, engineering, and art (including one formula derivation, two graph interpretations, one problem-solving strategy), and obtain final approval via peer review (meeting 4+ of 5 rubric criteria) and teacher verification.",
    "Learners can form 4–5-member collaborative teams to design three project-based math assessment tools (e.g., statistical analysis poster, geometric model design, function-based game development) over six months, achieving an average score of 80+ on peer/teacher rubrics (25% creativity, 25% collaboration, 30% mathematical accuracy, 20% completion)."
