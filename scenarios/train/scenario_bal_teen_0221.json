  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic programming concepts, internet usage experience, foundational grammar and vocabulary skills for explaining technical content, and experience in reading simple technical documents",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "IoT application training in constrained smartphone environments, integrating technical document comprehension, writing, and presentation skills. Aims to develop practical language competencies: structuring technical texts, using specialized terminology, logical expression, and visual aids.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners explain three or more components of IoT systems (e.g., sensors, actuators, gateways) and operational principles (e.g., data collection-transmission-processing), and demonstrate the ability to articulate them accurately in technical documentation formats.",
    "Learners design a process for transforming everyday problems into IoT solutions using design thinking methodologies (empathize-define-ideate-prototype-test) and create structured texts (e.g., problem definition documents, solution specifications) that systematically explain technical content.",
    "Learners implement simple IoT scenario simulations using block-based coding tools (e.g., Scratch for IoT), document the process step-by-step, and present it following a logical flow.",
    "Learners analyze cross-domain cases (e.g., smart homes, agricultural IoT) to logically evaluate IoT applicability, then compile findings into structured reports (e.g., introduction-body-conclusion, with tables/graphs)."
