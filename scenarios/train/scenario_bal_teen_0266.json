  "title": "[K-12] Microlearning Course for Enhancing Social Phenomenon Inquiry Skills Based on Flipped Learning: Strengthening Civic Engagement and Evidence-Based Analysis",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic college-level social science theory and survey tool experience, understanding of social science inquiry methods (observation, hypothesis formation, variable control), and fundamental statistical analysis skills",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Designed primarily for first-year electrical and electronics engineering students, this course systematically develops the ability to investigate and analyze social phenomena through a flipped learning model. It provides a learning environment free from spatiotemporal constraints using digital devices and emphasizes citizen-participatory projects for solving local community issues. Activities are particularly designed to address real-world social problems such as cultural diversity, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and regional economic revitalization.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "After pre-learning experimental procedure videos and materials, learners achieve over 80% proficiency in analyzing cultural/environmental variables through social phenomenon observation, cultivating evidence collection and conclusion-drawing skills based on scientific inquiry methodologies",
    "Through peer discussions and formative assessments, learners enhance their ability to analyze social survey errors and write reports, strengthening their capacity to propose solutions for local issues from a civic rights perspective",
    "In a flipped learning environment, teams of 3–4 complete an inquiry design for a given social phenomenon (e.g., local culture survey, environmental issue analysis) within two weeks, submitting presentations and reports that meet at least four out of five team checklists (Clarity of Inquiry Purpose, Data Collection Methods, Collaboration Engagement, Evidence-Based Conclusion, Civic Engagement Promotion). This process cultivates the ability to consider political/economic contexts and propose institutional improvements"
