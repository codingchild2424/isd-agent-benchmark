  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Completion of full high school mathematics curriculum and foundational knowledge of college-level calculus",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Students watch pre-produced micro-lecture videos (5–7 minutes) before focusing on problem-solving and project collaboration in real-time classes. Project-based assessments measure the applicability of learning outcomes.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Students can self-study complex mathematical concepts through micro-course videos and explain core ideas.",
    "Students can complete collaborative projects solving real-world problems (e.g., optimization, modeling) in a flipped classroom setting.",
    "Students can present the process of applying concepts in online real-time classes and improve project outcomes by reflecting on feedback."
