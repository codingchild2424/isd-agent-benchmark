    "Learners visualize landscape design concepts using ≥3 AI image generation tools (Adobe Firefly, Bing Image Creator, Midjourney) and apply mathematical principles like geometric patterns (fractals, tessellations) and golden ratio calculations.",
    "Learners critically analyze AI-generated images to propose ≥2 design process applications (space optimization, material allocation) incorporating mathematical approaches such as symmetry/asymmetry analysis, coordinate system usage, etc.",
    "Learners analyze three images generated from experiential learning activities (nature observation, 3D modeling) and design one prototype applicable to a small-scale school landscaping project (flowerbeds, walking paths). They document mathematical problem-solving processes (area calculation ≤50㎡, scale adjustment 1:10–1:50, trigonometric functions) and achieve ≥3 points (\"Excellent\" grade) on ≥2 of four teacher evaluation rubric items (creativity, practicality, completeness, mathematical accuracy) out of 4."
