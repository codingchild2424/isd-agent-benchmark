  "title": "[K-12] Evolution of Online Learning and Language Education Application Strategies: Exploring Text, Vocabulary, and Communication for Digital Literacy Enhancement",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Experience with basic online learning platforms (LMS), intermediate+ language proficiency (integrated reading-writing-listening-speaking), foundational digital resource utilization, basic grammar comprehension, and vocabulary expansion experience",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Content design optimized for smartphone-based learning. Aims to improve practical language skills (communication, text generation, cultural context understanding) through project-based assessments. Emphasizes grammar structure analysis, vocabulary expansion, and reading/expressive skill enhancement via diverse text types (expository, argumentative, creative writing).",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will explain three strategies to enhance language acquisition efficiency in online learning environments (context-based vocabulary learning, interactive listening/speaking activities, digital feedback utilization) and how they improve reading comprehension and expressive skills.",
    "Over two weeks, learners will use mobile-accessible digital resources (e.g., one podcast, one translation app) to create a self-directed learning plan at least three times weekly, record vocabulary expansion, grammar application, and syntactic analysis results following a learning journal template, and develop adaptability to diverse text types.",
    "Using online collaborative tools (e.g., Google Docs, Padlet), learners will complete a theme-based language project (e.g., travel brochure) with three peers over two weeks, achieve at least an \"Average\" rating in four of the five peer evaluation rubric items (Grammatical Accuracy, Vocabulary Diversity, Text Cohesion, Creativity, Collaborative Attitude), and demonstrate culturally contextualized communication skills."
