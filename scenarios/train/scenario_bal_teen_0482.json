  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic learning theories and comprehension of educational technology",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Targeting graduate-level mathematics education majors, the program focuses on enhancing UDL (Universal Design for Learning)-based lesson design competencies for students with diverse learning abilities. Conducted in a smartphone-centric limited-technology environment, it requires the use of mobile-friendly supplementary materials.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "By applying the five phases of the ADDIE model (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation), learners can design UDL educational resources specialized for mathematics subjects",
    "Using the Innovation Diffusion Theory, learners can integrate core principles of the UDL framework into mathematics instruction",
    "Through project-based assessment, learners can develop UDL mathematics activity designs applicable in real classroom settings and incorporate peer feedback",
    "Pre- and post-self-assessment surveys can quantitatively measure changes in UDL comprehension and practical application abilities"
