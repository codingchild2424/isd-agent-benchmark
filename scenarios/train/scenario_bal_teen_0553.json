    "Learners autonomously acquire design thinking concepts through digital program learning materials and are evaluated on their application skills.",
    "Learners will form 4-person teams to select one real-world math problem (e.g., spatial utilization, resource distribution) identified in schools or communities, apply the 5-stage design thinking process (empathize-define-ideate-prototype-test), and produce a project report achieving \"excellent\" ratings in two or more of three rubric criteria (problem definition clarity, creativity, feasibility)."
