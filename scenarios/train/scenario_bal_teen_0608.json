  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic academic search skills, understanding of action research concepts, foundational competencies in text analysis and reading comprehension, and basic vocabulary comprehension and grammar structure recognition",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course designed to effectively process and integrate behavioral research literature in smartphone-based online environments, emphasizing improvements in reading comprehension, expressive skills, and text analysis techniques, including in-depth learning of academic vocabulary usage and text structure recognition.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Using an ontology-based search system, learners can identify core concepts (constructs, causal relationships) in behavioral research literature with 85% accuracy while strengthening text structure analysis and vocabulary pattern recognition skills.",
    "By visually mapping relationships between diverse theories, learners can secure logical expression and text synthesis skills when designing research frameworks.",
    "Compared to existing systems, learners improve literature comprehension and contextual synthesis by reducing false positives by 40% and enhancing integrated theory efficiency by 30%."
