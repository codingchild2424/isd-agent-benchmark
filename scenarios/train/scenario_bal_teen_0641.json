  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic psychology theories, foundational understanding of clinical settings, therapeutic communication techniques, basic grammar structures (sentence formation, tense agreement), and mastery of core vocabulary for emotional expression",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Simulation/VR-based",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Providing Content Optimized for Smartphone-Based Mobile Learning. Emphasizing Linguistic Interaction Skills (Emotion-Reflective Expressions, Therapeutic Questioning Techniques) in Real-Time Case Analysis and Decision-Making Training via VR Simulations. Focus on Improving Learners' Expressive Abilities (Emotional Vocabulary Diversity), Reading Comprehension (Interpretation of Patient Statements), and Emotional Reflection Skills (Generating Empathetic Responses)",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Development of the ability to analyze verbal (nonverbal cue interpretation) and nonverbal communication patterns in clinical cases within VR simulation environments and establish therapeutic intervention strategies.",
    "Performing a 5-minute dialogue scenario applying the \"thought–emotion–action\" connection model on an online role-play platform, learners must achieve at least an \"Average\" grade in three of five peer evaluation rubric items: role immersion, linguistic accuracy, emotional reflection ability, vocabulary appropriateness, and grammatical structure accuracy.",
    "During the application of acquired clinical psychology knowledge to real cases through summative assessments, learners’ ability to utilize effective language expression (emotional vocabulary, clear sentence structure) and listening skills (empathic responses, summarization techniques) is measured."
