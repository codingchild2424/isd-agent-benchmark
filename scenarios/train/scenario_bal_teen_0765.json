  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic machine learning concepts, experience with remote sensing data processing, understanding of deep learning model architectures, foundational English grammar and vocabulary knowledge, comprehension of text generation model evaluation methodologies",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",

    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "In a simulated environment with limited labeled data, learners practice high-quality natural language caption generation techniques and explore methods to improve model performance through self-learning algorithms. They utilize multilingual evaluation metrics (ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, etc.) for assessing the expressiveness and accuracy of generated captions, along with grammar error analysis tools.",
