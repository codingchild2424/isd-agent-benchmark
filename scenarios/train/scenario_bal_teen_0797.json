  "title": "[K-12] Science Inquiry E-Learning Pedagogy Development Based on the ICARE Learning Model: Integrated Hypothesis-Experiment-Analysis Approach",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Core scientific theories (energy, ecosystems, etc.), understanding of scientific methodologies (hypothesis formulation, variable control), and foundational experimental design competencies (measurement tool usage, data recording)",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Science inquiry e-learning instructional design process conducted via PBL in smartphone-centric limited-technology environments. Learners systematically experience the scientific inquiry process, including variable control (distinguishing independent/dependent/control variables), quantitative/qualitative data measurement, graph-based result analysis, and verifying the validity of experimental conclusions through peer review.",

    "learner_age": "Teens (13-19)",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Cultivate the ability to design e-learning content reflecting the scientific inquiry process (hypothesis setting → variable control → experimentation → data analysis → conclusion drawing) using the ICARE model’s five stages (Introduction-Connection-Application-Reflection-Extension).",
    "Learners collaborate in 3–5 member teams using smartphone-based collaboration tools to complete three science experiment projects (including observation, measurement, and evidence collection) within a 6-month course, demonstrating collaborative competency with an average score of 4/5 or higher in peer evaluations and expert feedback.",
    "Ensure e-learning content quality management through expert validation based on scientific evidence (experimental reproducibility, data reliability assessment) and learner formative/summative evaluations."
