    "Learners can explain at least three causes of climate change and solutions through augmented reality games.",
    "In teams of 3–4, learners complete in-game collaborative missions (e.g., virtual city energy-saving project) and write a sustainable lifestyle design plan (including three energy-saving strategies and two recycling system proposals). They achieve ≥70/100 points on the teacher evaluation rubric (creativity 20%, feasibility 30%, collaboration participation 50%).",
    "Analyzing ARG data collected over one week, learners propose ≥3 environmental impact reduction strategies (e.g., energy saving, recycling promotion) individually and by group, and write a report achieving ≥14/20 points on the teacher evaluation rubric (clarity, feasibility, effectiveness)."
