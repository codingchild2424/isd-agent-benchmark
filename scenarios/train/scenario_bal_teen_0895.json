  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can visualize three molecular structures (water, carbon dioxide, methane) using an AR application (e.g., MERGE Cube), measure each molecule’s bond angles with ≤5° error, and implement interactions (rotation, zoom) to write a lab report.",
    "Provide personalized feedback based on individual learning pattern data at least three times",
    "Based on a one-week learning analytics report, learners can specifically outline ≥3 self-directed learning strategies (e.g., time management, goal setting, feedback utilization) and develop an action plan meeting ≥4 of 5 teacher-verified checklist items."
