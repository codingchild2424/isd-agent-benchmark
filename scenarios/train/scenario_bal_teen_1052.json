    "Learners explain a four-stage intervention model for online violence (awareness-responsibility-intervention-follow-up) with 85% accuracy and demonstrate the ability to interpret social relationships from civic rights and human sensitivity perspectives.",
    "Learners apply citizenship-enhancing intervention strategies based on social relationship analysis in simulation scenarios for three consecutive successful attempts.",
    "Learners select one community issue (e.g., illegal dumping, school safety), conduct case studies in teams of 3–4, write 3-page project reports with three prevention strategies, and propose one institutional improvement plan from a civic participation perspective for local administrative agencies."
