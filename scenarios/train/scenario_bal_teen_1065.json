  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic mining safety protocols and equipment operation experience, foundational understanding of social responsibility and public safety, and awareness of community collaboration systems",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A blended education program combining hands-on VR training modules with theoretical knowledge, utilizing simulations of real mining environments. Aims to establish a safety culture in industrial sites and enhance community safety awareness, including measures to protect citizens' rights and improve safety-related systems.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "In a VR environment, learners will analyze virtual mining disaster scenarios, perform scientific evidence-based safety response procedures with over 90% accuracy, and propose practical measures to establish a citizen safety culture.",
    "Learners will identify five major risk factors in mining workplaces (collapses, gas leaks, fires, etc.), explain prevention strategies from a social responsibility perspective, and discuss ways to enhance community safety awareness.",
    "Through team-based projects, learners will design and evaluate VR training modules to improve mining safety protocols and contribute to developing citizen-participatory safety education programs."
