    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Blended learning combining digital/analog activities in a BYOD environment, emphasizing collaborative problem-solving through group work, with language support tools (grammar checkers, vocabulary expansion tools) to enhance learners' writing, speaking, and listening skills",

    "Learners will design hypothetical learning trajectories (HLT) for comparative problem-solving in STEM-integrated environments, integrating scientific inquiry processes with linguistic expressions (grammar, vocabulary, text structure).",
    "Using design-based research (DBR) methodologies, learners will iteratively improve learning activities and provide clear text-based feedback (writing/reading) during problem-solving processes.",
    "Learners will systematically solve real-world problems through quantitative/qualitative comparative analysis and present results via structured reports (writing) or oral presentations (speaking/expression)."
