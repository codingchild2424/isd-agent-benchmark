  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic digital literacy, language learning experience (reading/writing/speaking proficiency and grammatical comprehension), SNS-based communication experience, and fundamental mobile device operation skills",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Emphasizes real-time collaboration using personal devices (group writing, role-playing to enhance expression skills) and personalized learning experiences (individual vocabulary level diagnostics and grammar checker integration). Focuses on integrating mobile tools (grammar checkers, pronunciation evaluation apps, automatic translation tools) in language learning contexts. Particularly requires differentiated strategies according to K-12 learners' language development stages.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can analyze three mobile learning design patterns (e.g., microlearning, gamification, augmented reality) and design a language education framework integrating grammar, vocabulary, and expressions, submitting a systematic draft within one week to enhance K-12 learners' reading comprehension, writing proficiency, and oral communication skills.",
    "Based on literature analysis, learners compare effective mobile learning strategies (focused on reading, writing, and speaking) across K-12, higher education, and vocational training contexts, proposing digital tool utilization plans aligned with language acquisition goals at each stage.",
    "Learners perform three activities in Zoom-based real-time classes using a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) environment: ① text-based collaborative tasks (Google Docs co-authoring and peer feedback integration), ② pronunciation practice (Zoom voice recording and pronunciation assessment app integration), and ③ feedback cycles (providing three types of feedback—grammar, expression, pronunciation—in chat), completing each at least once and submitting practical results meeting at least two of three checklist items per activity."
