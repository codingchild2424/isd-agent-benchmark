    "Learners accurately convert vectors into graphical and algebraic representations in diverse physical contexts (e.g., force, motion).",
    "Learners can perform vector addition by progressing through the stages of concrete objects (model arrows) → semi-concrete objects (digital vector tools) → abstract symbols (coordinate notation).",
    "Learners can explain vector operations by connecting their geometric meaning (e.g., parallelogram law) with algebraic representations (component-wise calculations)."
