  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic language learning experience (reading, writing, speaking), digital device proficiency, elementary grammar comprehension, and foundational concepts of scientific inquiry methods",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course focused on implementing learning flows using IMS LD standards within a smartphone-centric, limited technological environment. Emphasizes designing activities to improve learners' reading comprehension, writing, and communication skills, with a focus on establishing evidence-based learning strategies based on formative assessment data.",

    "learner_age": "Teens (13-19)",
    "learner_education": "Elementary",
    "learner_role": "Student",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can explain the fundamental principles and components of IMS LD-based learning design and apply scientific inquiry methods to language learning activities (reading, writing, speaking).",
    "Learners can simulate language learning flows (reading, writing, speaking activities) using Petri net models, analyze variables at each stage, and optimize learning outcomes.",
    "Learners can flexibly modify an open-architecture learning design engine and apply it to diverse language learning scenarios (grammar, vocabulary, expressive skills enhancement).",
    "Learners can systematically analyze monthly formative assessment results (10 grammar items, 10 vocabulary items, 5 expressive skills items), select two areas with ≥30% error rates, and develop personalized learning plans (e.g., 3 grammar supplement sessions, 5 additional vocabulary quizzes)."
