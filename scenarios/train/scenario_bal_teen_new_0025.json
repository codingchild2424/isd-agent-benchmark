  "title": "[K-12] Virtual Space Simulation-Based Language Communication Competency Enhancement Program",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic language proficiency (reading, writing, listening, speaking), intercultural communication awareness, and recognition of fundamental grammar structures. Additionally, ability to construct simple discourse and experience in context-specific vocabulary selection",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Student-led projects in smartphone-based restricted technological environments, emphasizing communication efficiency and vocabulary expansion in virtual spaces. Particularly evaluates digital communication characteristics (emojis/abbreviations) and the ability to switch between formal/informal contexts.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "In virtual simulation environments, learners successfully perform at least three intercultural negotiation scenarios, applying appropriate vocabulary selection and expression strategies for each context. They particularly utilize specialized terminology and idiomatic expressions suitable for business contexts.",
    "Through peer feedback and reflective journaling, learners improve at least two integrated listening-speaking language use strategies. Specifically, they strengthen pragmatic strategies and discourse marker usage.",
    "As team-based project deliverables, learners propose communication protocols applicable to real business situations and enhance text-based negotiation skills. They refine structuring negotiation texts and persuasive expression techniques."
