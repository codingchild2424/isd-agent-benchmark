  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational language education theories (reading, writing, listening, speaking), understanding of grammatical systems, elementary education practical experience, and basic digital literacy competency",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Strengthening blended learning design capabilities in smartphone-based limited-technology environments. It emphasizes vocabulary expansion, contextual understanding, and grammar application activities for learners with low digital literacy. Language proficiency is holistically developed through text-based interactions and offline writing activities.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Compare and analyze educational characteristics of computer-based and face-to-face learning, and evaluate their impacts on elementary learners’ vocabulary acquisition, grammar comprehension, and contextual inference.",
    "Design effective blended learning strategies in limited technological environments to balance improvements in learners’ expressive, reading, and writing skills.",
    "Create a lesson plan integrating online-offline activities in language education contexts, systematically linking text analysis, writing tasks, and grammar application exercises."
