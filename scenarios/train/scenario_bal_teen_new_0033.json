  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic language structures (grammar, vocabulary) and educational theories (instructional design), fundamental digital text comprehension skills, and elementary knowledge of scientific inquiry methods (observation, hypothesis formulation, experiment design)",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Mobile-optimized content combining practical language instruction (writing, reading, expressive activities) with theoretical application in small-scale customized learning environments using digital devices. Emphasizes improving learners' critical thinking and creative expression, highlighting language skill development through scientific inquiry processes. Each activity includes stages of observational recording, data analysis, and evidence-based conclusion drawing.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners must complete 12 mobile-based language modules (grammar, vocabulary, text analysis) with ≥85% completion within six months, developing hypothesis-setting and evidence-based conclusion skills per module.",
    "Learners must achieve ≥90% accuracy in formative assessments analyzing/critically evaluating diverse language materials, applying variable control and data-driven analysis.",
    "Through ≥3 project-based assignments, learners must develop two language instructional designs (integrating reading/writing) applicable to K-12 settings, submit final designs meeting ≥4 of 5 peer/teacher evaluation criteria (clarity, feasibility, creativity, pedagogical effectiveness, linguistic accuracy), and systematically apply the scientific inquiry process (observation-hypothesis-experiment-analysis-conclusion)."
