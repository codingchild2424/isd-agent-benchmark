  "title": "[K-12] Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) and Data-Informed Learning Design (DILD) Integrated Language Education Course for Pre-Service Teachers: Enhancing Text, Expression, and Reading Comprehension Skills",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic general education knowledge, understanding of Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) concepts, fundamental data interpretation skills, foundational language education theories and methodologies (integrated reading, writing, speaking, listening), and basic grammar and vocabulary knowledge",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A curriculum combining case-based practice (e.g., emotional expression activities in multicultural classroom scenarios), data analysis (diagnosing learner needs), and language expression activities (writing/speaking/role-play) to help pre-service teachers effectively apply SEL elements in future language classes. Particularly emphasizes an integrated approach to improving learners’ reading comprehension, expression, and social-emotional awareness.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners explain the five core SEL competencies (self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, responsible decision-making) within a language learning context (especially text analysis, vocabulary expansion, expressive activities).",
    "Learners analyze simple survey data to diagnose connections between learners' socioemotional needs and language skills (reading, writing, speaking).",
    "Learners design an SEL-integrated language lesson plan based on the DILD framework, incorporate peer feedback, and finalize a teaching plan integrating grammar, vocabulary, and communication strategies.",
    "In offline settings, learners use one smartphone and basic apps (recorder, camera, etc.) to design SEL-related language activities (two role-plays: conversational expressions/emotional vocabulary practice, one expressive activity: emotional diary writing) and propose an activity plan meeting ≥4 out of 5 peer evaluation rubric criteria (creativity, linguistic accuracy, SEL integration, interaction, practicality)."
