  "title": "[K-12] Language Education Storytelling Design Using Film Production Techniques: Integrated Reading and Expression Education through Enhanced Visual Representation and Narrative Structure",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic language proficiency (grammar, vocabulary), experience in educational content creation, fundamental video editing skills, and reading comprehension for narrative structure understanding",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Focuses on enhancing learners' writing and expressive skills through smartphone-based engagement, real-time interaction, and collaborative learning. Emphasizes context-based language acquisition using cinematic techniques (montage, shot composition). Integrates vocabulary and grammar learning during the text-to-video conversion process to amplify learning effects.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners enhance their ability to design logical coherence in narrative flow and dialogue structure for language learning scenarios by applying the three-act structure (setup, confrontation, resolution) of filmmaking.",
    "Learners can develop emotional engagement (empathy) and expressive diversity (vocabulary, sentence structures) in language learning motivation content by applying character arc techniques.",
    "Learners can produce three or more 1-minute visual storytelling videos using smartphone filming/editing tools (e.g., CapCut, iMovie) and design a language education module integrating 10+ target vocabulary items (high-frequency/context-specific) and 3+ grammatical structures (complex sentences, conjunctions). The module must meet 4+ of 5 peer evaluation criteria: creativity, grammatical accuracy, lexical diversity, narrative consistency, and technical proficiency."
