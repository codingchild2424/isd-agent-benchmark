    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A language learning environment using digital devices (tablets/laptops) and speech recognition software. Emphasizes real-time learner-teacher interaction (writing feedback, oral presentation evaluation, pronunciation correction). Integrates text analysis tools (lexical frequency analysis, grammar error detection) with speech recognition software (pronunciation assessment, fluency measurement).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "When designing IBL lessons, learners can establish plans to use text/speech analysis tools that predict learners’ language inquiry pathways (reading, writing, speaking, listening).",
    "Learners can execute ≥3 strategies for flexible language class adjustments via real-time learning data monitoring (e.g., vocabulary expansion, grammatical feedback, expression diversification, pronunciation correction).",
    "When designing IBL activities, learners achieve ≥80% on assessments evaluating their ability to map language learning objectives (grammatical accuracy, lexical diversity, text comprehension, discourse competence) to analytical metrics."
