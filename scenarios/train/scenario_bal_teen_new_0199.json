  "title": "[K-12] Interdisciplinary Collaborative Learning and Scientific Inquiry Competency Development Program for Medical Science Students",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic medical and nursing knowledge, at least one clinical practice experience, and foundational understanding of scientific experimental design (observation, hypothesis formulation, experimentation) and data analysis (measurement, statistical processing)",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A program addressing the lack of role awareness as healthcare team members and collaboration experience with students from other disciplines. Provides flexible learning environments through mobile-based learning modules. Integrates scientific methodologies (observation, hypothesis formulation, experimental design, data analysis, evidence-based conclusions) into collaborative projects to cultivate problem-solving skills for real medical settings. Particularly strengthens scientific inquiry competencies required in medical fields (variable control, data interpretation, objective evidence presentation).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Improve understanding of interdisciplinary collaboration and team-based healthcare environments by ≥80%, cultivating problem-solving skills via scientific inquiry (hypothesis, variable control, experimental design).",
    "Enhance RILS (Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale) scores by ≥25% from baseline, strengthen evidence-based decision-making through experimental data analysis.",
    "In a 4–5-member interdisciplinary team (medicine, engineering, arts), learners must perform one role (planner, researcher, presenter), write four weekly meeting logs, produce a ≤10-minute final presentation, achieve “Excellent” in ≥3 of 5 project evaluation criteria, and apply systematic variable control/hypothesis testing for scientific validation."
