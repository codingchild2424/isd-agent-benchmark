  "learning_goals": [
    "Students demonstrate the ability to solve real-world problems (e.g., discount rates, ratio calculations) using proportional relationships (ratio=quantity/quantity) with over 85% accuracy.",
    "Learners can identify and correct at least three error patterns based on real-time feedback provided by the CT system.",
    "Post-training evaluation results show a 40% or greater improvement in learners' conceptual understanding of proportional reasoning compared to pre-assessment."
