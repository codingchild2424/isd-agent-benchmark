    "Over 2–4 weeks, learners can form teams of two peer learners using online collaboration tools like GitHub Classroom, complete a web-based language learning app with three core features (login, data storage, API integration) using a project management board (Kanban board), and achieve over 4 points (out of 5) in at least two of three peer evaluation rubric items (feature completeness, collaboration engagement, code quality)."
