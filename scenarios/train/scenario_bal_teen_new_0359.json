    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A process enabling collaborative learning with digital devices, providing customized scaffolding based on learners' prior knowledge, and systematically practicing the full scientific inquiry cycle (experiment design-data collection-analysis-conclusion). Especially emphasizes variable control and evidence-based conclusions.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can collaboratively design concept maps that connect core concepts (variables, hypotheses, experimental design) of given science topics (e.g., photosynthesis, chemical reactions).",
    "Learners utilize digital tools (e.g., CmapTools) to visualize hierarchical structures between concepts according to scaffolding support levels, constructing logical relationships based on experimental data analysis and scientific evidence.",
    "Through peer assessment, learners improve the logical consistency of concept maps (observation-hypothesis-experiment-analysis-conclusion structure) by over 80% and strengthen their ability to derive evidence-based conclusions."
