    "Learners can explain and apply at least three academic reading and writing strategies (e.g., analyzing paper structure, utilizing specialized vocabulary, constructing logical counterarguments in online discussions) required in online higher education.",
    "Learners can practice academic interaction methods with peers in a virtual discussion room (e.g., using specialized terminology, developing evidence-based arguments, accepting feedback) and achieve an 80% or higher participation rate with at least four qualitative interactions (questions, counterarguments, summaries).",
    "Learners can submit a one-week time management and study-life balance plan that meets the following criteria: 1) specifies daily allocation of reading, writing, and rest time based on a five-day week, 2) demonstrates the feasibility of achieving at least three out of four teacher-provided checklist items, and 3) uses concise expressions appropriate for academic contexts (within one A4 page).",
    "Learners can utilize at least five basic functions of online learning platforms (Zoom, LMS) (e.g., video presentations, assignment submissions, discussion board participation) and use them with academic expressions (e.g., using specialized terminology during presentations, formal tone when requesting feedback)."
