  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic principles of spatial organization, understanding of design elements, and foundational knowledge of social systems, civic rights, and local economic structures",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learners access a VR platform via personal devices (BYOD) to complete asynchronous tutorials, simulation tasks, and peer feedback activities. In LMS discussion boards, they analyze urban design case studies and share creative ideas considering cultural diversity. Includes spatial design projects for solving community issues—particularly emphasizing harmonizing historical preservation with modern urban functions and reflecting diverse societal needs.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Complete three or more public facility design projects in a VR environment using 3D spatial modeling tools, implementing spatial arrangements that consider citizens' rights and social equity.",
    "Learners apply spatial cognition theories (spatial hierarchy, accessibility, etc.) and urban planning principles (mixed-use development, green space allocation, etc.) to create an A3-sized spatial design plan reflecting at least three citizen needs (e.g., pedestrian safety, community spaces, cultural diversity) and achieve a 'B' (80+ points) grade in four out of five teacher evaluation rubric criteria.",
    "Improve and optimize two or more spatial design prototypes through peer review and citizen participation simulations, considering political and institutional constraints for solving community issues."
