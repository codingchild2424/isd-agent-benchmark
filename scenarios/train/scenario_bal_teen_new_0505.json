    "Learners apply pre-provided flipped learning materials to solve on-site problems, demonstrating ≥80% proficiency in required mathematical theories",
    "Over three weeks, learners write a 3–5-page analysis report applying two or more mathematical analysis methods (mean, ratio, graphs, etc.) using local cases (e.g., traffic volume near schools, local store sales data), and achieve a grade of 'B' (70–80%) or higher in four of the five teacher evaluation rubric items."
