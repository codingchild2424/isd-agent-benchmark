  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic language proficiency (reading comprehension, writing, grammar understanding) and experience using digital learning tools, with foundational vocabulary mapping abilities",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Simulation/VR-based",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A blended learning course based on simulation/VR in smartphone-centric, resource-limited environments. While prioritizing summative assessment, it strengthens collaborative learning competencies through knowledge-building activities (collaborative text creation, vocabulary mapping, grammar error feedback, expressive variation practice). Emphasizes critical thinking and creative expression skills.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can perform collective cognitive responsibility by evaluating text structure analysis and thematic vocabulary expansion processes through collaborative observation with peers in a language learning community.",
    "Over six months, learners can collaborate with two peers in weekly hybrid (online/offline) classes to complete three or more projects applying language knowledge (50+ thematic vocabulary items, 10+ grammar applications) and learning strategies (note-taking, question generation, expression diversification) using simulation/VR tools (e.g., VR Chat, Google Tour Creator). They must submit deliverables meeting at least four out of five teacher evaluation checklist criteria (grammar accuracy, vocabulary diversity, creativity, collaboration, completeness).",
    "Learners can measure and improve language learning outcomes based on self- and peer-assessment (reading accuracy, writing fluency, presentation expressiveness, vocabulary appropriateness)."
