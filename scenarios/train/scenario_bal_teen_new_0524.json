  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic agricultural management knowledge, basic smartphone app usage skills, foundational understanding of scientific inquiry methods (observation-hypothesis formulation-experimentation-analysis-conclusion), and skills in variable control and data recording",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learners aim for advanced expertise in managing small-scale buffalo farms, focusing on developing field problem-solving skills combining smart technology and scientific analysis. They perform practice-centered projects in a BYOD environment and systematically learn data-driven decision-making processes. Scientific thinking is strengthened through experimental design, data collection/analysis, and evidence-based conclusion drawing.",

    "Applying the ADDIE model, learners execute the agricultural management app design process step-by-step, verifying system efficiency through scientific inquiry methods (hypothesis formulation–experimentation–analysis–conclusion drawing).",
    "Learners select three core features of a digital buffalo farm management system (e.g., individual feed intake tracking, weight change monitoring, estrus cycle tracking) and design one simple flowchart or wireframe reflecting scientific variables (time, environmental conditions, feed composition) within two weeks.",
    "Learners apply user-centered design principles (accessibility, intuitiveness) to prototype an app interface reflecting farmers’ needs (e.g., crop management, weather checks) using Figma or similar tools. Integrating data measurement and analysis functions, they achieve over 70 points on a peer evaluation rubric (functionality 30%, usability 30%, creativity 20%, scientific rigor 10%, completeness 10%), while assessing the reliability and validity of experimental data.",
    "Through project-based assessments over 2–4 weeks, learners design mobile app prototypes applicable to real farm management scenarios (e.g., crop yield prediction, irrigation system optimization) using Figma or MIT App Inventor. Based on scientific evidence (data collection–analysis–conclusion), they achieve over 70 points (out of 100) on a teacher evaluation rubric (functionality 30%, feasibility 30%, creativity 20%, scientific validity 20%). Final outputs must be evidence-based designs grounded in experimental results and data analysis."
