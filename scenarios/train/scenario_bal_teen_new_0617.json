  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic language proficiency (reading, writing, speaking, listening) and fundamental digital device utilization skills, basic grammar comprehension, experience analyzing diverse text types.",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A customized language education course for adult learners, emphasizing interaction through online discussions and peer evaluation. Focuses on improving learners' expressive and reading comprehension skills, including activities for analyzing various text types. Strengthens critical thinking competencies by integrating scientific inquiry methods (hypothesis setting, evidence collection, conclusion drawing) into language learning.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners in blended learning environments can establish self-directed study plans using online materials/tools at least three times weekly, integrate vocabulary expansion and grammatical structure analysis, and systematically observe various text types (expository, argumentative, narrative).",
    "Learners can fluently produce five or more sentences in 30-minute real-time online discussions three times weekly, provide two or more specific feedbacks on peers’ presentations, exchange opinions via text-based chat with over 80% grammatical accuracy in ten or more sentences, and conduct evidence-based analysis of peers’ written texts.",
    "Learners engage in self-reflection (writing, reading comprehension, grammatical error analysis) through project-based assessments, document learning outcomes in portfolio format, and derive conclusions reflecting process variables (time management, resource utilization)."
