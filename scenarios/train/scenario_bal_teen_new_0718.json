  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic assessment methodologies, organizational development theories, community-based project experience, foundational statistics (mean/variance/standard deviation) and data analysis competencies, and understanding of linear equations and graphical representations.",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A project-based learning environment for practical competency enhancement. Learners utilize real community data to perform mathematical modeling (optimization problems, simulations) and statistical analysis (regression analysis, hypothesis testing), verifying the scientific validity of evaluation systems. Particularly systematizes decision-making processes through probability distribution modeling and data visualization.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can design a three-phase (planning-execution-evaluation) assessment system for school club operations (e.g., participation, performance metrics) using linear equations and graph models, demonstrating instructional design competencies that meet ≥80% suitability in peer reviews and teacher evaluations. They validate the scientific validity of assessment indicators through regression analysis and correlation calculations.",
    "Learners can apply probabilistic elements of organizational change models (Markov chains, Monte Carlo simulations) and statistical analyses of stakeholder motivation strategies (regression, t-tests) to assessment competency enhancement programs.",
    "Learners can plan, execute, and evaluate assessment competency development projects reflecting community sector characteristics, performing data-driven decision-making. They optimize decision-making processes using statistical techniques such as sampling, hypothesis testing, and ANOVA."
