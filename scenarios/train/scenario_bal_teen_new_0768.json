  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic statistical analysis and research methodology understanding, foundational knowledge of educational technology concepts, experience in designing language assessments (reading/writing/listening/speaking), and basic text analysis capabilities",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "An environment enabling access to smartphone-based language learning materials and simple practice tools (e.g., text analysis software, vocabulary frequency analyzers). It considers K-12 learners' language development stages (grammar system formation, expanded expressive diversity).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can analyze and explain the relationship between measurement errors and latent variables (e.g., reading comprehension, expressive ability, vocabulary acquisition) in language learning technology experiments using SEM.",
    "Learners develop research design capabilities to verify through SEM the mediating processes by which educational interventions (e.g., digital reading/writing training) enhance language proficiency (grammar structure understanding, text interpretation skills).",
    "Learners can compare the differences between traditional experimental design (MANCOVA) and SEM-based approaches to select appropriate methods for analyzing language education data (speaking fluency, listening comprehension)."
