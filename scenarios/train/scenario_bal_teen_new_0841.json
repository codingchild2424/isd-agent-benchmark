  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic science concepts (variable control, hypothesis formulation) and college-level language proficiency (grammar/vocabulary analysis, text interpretation, discourse structure understanding)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A graduate-level language course conducting project-based assessments in smartphone-centric, resource-limited environments. Learners analyze language data collected via mobile devices (conversation recordings, SNS texts) with a focus on activities combining scientific inquiry methods (observation-measurement-conclusion) and linguistic analysis (text structure-pragmatic context).",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners analyze complex linguistic data (text/audio) to generate scientific hypotheses and systematically present linguistic evidence (grammar/lexical patterns).",
    "Through collaborative problem-solving with peers, learners strengthen critical reading skills and argumentation structures by collecting and evaluating evidence from linguistic materials.",
    "After observing three real-language phenomena (conversations/texts), learners define two problems and generate one inquiry question per case, then write a 500-character exploratory draft integrating expressive and analytical skills."
