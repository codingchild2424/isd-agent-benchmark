    "Strategic tools (artefact-strategy) for solving symmetry problems in game environments are designed, and the ability to apply them is evaluated.",
    "Mathematical abstractions occurring during gameplay are documented and explained by connecting them to scientific concepts.",
    "Learners will form teams of 3–4 members, select one observed phenomenon from daily life (e.g., bicycle speed, plant growth), and produce a report with visual aids that outlines a three-stage process (observation-hypothesis-modeling) to convert it into a mathematical model (graphs, equations, etc.) for presentation."
