    "Learners can regularly self-assess 21st-century competencies (creativity, collaboration, critical thinking) during maker projects",
    "In a two-week gamification project (level-up, badge acquisition, point system), learners write reflective journals three or more times weekly, incorporating three elements (learning summary, areas for improvement, gamification effectiveness) per entry, achieving a motivation index of 4.0+ (5-point scale) in the final assessment.",
    "Over three weeks, learners set a maker project goal (Arduino-based IoT device or web portfolio development), complete three activities (hardware assembly, code implementation, UI design) per weekly checklist (design→development→testing→feedback), and submit a functional prototype with ≥80% completion or a ≥3-minute demonstration video."
