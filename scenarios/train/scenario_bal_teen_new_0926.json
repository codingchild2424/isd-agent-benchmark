    "Generate documentation with a 3:1 text:code ratio following literate programming principles",
    "Perform preprocessing and visualization of satellite observation data using modularized functions",
    "Learners can identify three or more real-world environmental issues (e.g., fine dust concentration distribution, factory emission impact range) using satellite-based Earth Observation (EO) data in a 1–6-month air pollution analysis project and include analyzed results with data visualization tools (graphs/maps) in a project report (5+ pages)."
