    "Learners will analyze application cases of the \"sensory exploration principle\" in digital learning sheets, apply them to social studies projects (e.g., local culture research, political system comparisons), and contribute to civic competency development.",
    "Learners will develop self-assessment tools for measuring cognitive (conceptual understanding) and psychomotor (field research) learning outcomes in social studies and demonstrate critical thinking in solving social issues."
