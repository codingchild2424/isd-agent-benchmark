    "Learners can develop a simple simulation prototype (e.g., game, physics phenomenon model) applying real-world mathematical modeling (e.g., linear equations, probability distributions) in Python or Scratch within one week and submit a result meeting three or more of the five teacher-provided evaluation criteria (functionality, creativity, accuracy, completeness, documentation)."
