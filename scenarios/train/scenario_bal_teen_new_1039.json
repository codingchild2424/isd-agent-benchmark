    "After watching three video materials on social issues (e.g., environmental problems, human rights issues), learners can identify two explicit pieces of information and one implicit message, then write an analysis report following a 3-step reasoning process (information extraction → connection → conclusion drawing).",
    "Enhance the ability to apply three or more reasoning types (cause-effect, prediction, evaluation) through video-based interactive activities",
    "In a PBL (Problem-Based Learning) environment, learners can produce an infographic or a 1-page report (≈500 characters) analyzing inference results related to social phenomena, achieving a grade of 'B' (70–80 points) or higher in at least two out of three teacher evaluation rubric criteria (clarity of theme, visual effectiveness, logical structure)."
