  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic language proficiency (reading, writing, grammar comprehension) and foundational understanding of collaborative learning. Learners should possess basic digital tool usage skills, foundational knowledge in text analysis, and comprehension of vocabulary expansion and creative expression concepts",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Offline collaborative learning using digital devices (tablets/laptops). Students form 4-5 member teams for language projects, with instructors designing/supporting activities based on collaboration flow patterns and scripts. Aims to improve reading comprehension, writing, creative expression, and digital literacy, emphasizing expressive skill enhancement through text structure analysis and vocabulary expansion.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners apply the 3-stage Collaborative Learning Flow Pattern (CLFP: Planning → Execution → Reflection) to design team language projects (e.g., digital storytelling, role-play videos). Over 4 weeks, they achieve ≥80% weekly checklist completion, present final outputs, and utilize text structure analysis, vocabulary expansion, and creative expression techniques while aiming to minimize grammatical errors and enhance presentation fluency",
    "Learners collaborate in 4–5 member teams to: 1) create a role distribution table (e.g., leader, recorder, presenter) for given scenarios, 2) establish communication protocols (weekly meeting schedules, digital documentation methods, biweekly feedback cycles), and 3) submit integrated presentations (10-slide PPT) or reports (1,500 characters). Each phase must meet ≥12 out of 15 checklist items (80%) and achieve ≥4 points average (5-point scale) in peer evaluations. Notably, learners improve writing expressiveness (30% reduction in grammatical errors) and presentation fluency (50% reduction in stuttering) in final drafts through feedback incorporation",
    "Learners use online collaboration platforms (Google Docs, Padlet) in 4–6 member teams to complete language tasks (collaborative writing or project reports), meeting: 1) submission of ≥3-stage task division plans, 2) ≥80% deadline compliance (based on weekly checkpoints), and 3) ≥4 points (out of 5) in peer evaluation rubrics. They also utilize digital grammar-checking tools to achieve <5% grammatical errors, ≥4 points in text coherence (5-point scale), and ≥3 points in creative expression (5-point scale)"
