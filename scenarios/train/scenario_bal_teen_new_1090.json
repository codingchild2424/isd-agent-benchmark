  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational language education theories (grammar systems, vocabulary expansion strategies, text analysis methods), classroom management experience, digital tool proficiency, and experience with language learning apps",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Emphasizes designing field-applicable language education in smartphone-centric limited-technology environments. Focuses on developing activity designs and assessment tools to improve learners' expression and reading comprehension skills. Particularly concentrates on cultivating context-based language use abilities through grammar structure analysis and vocabulary expansion strategies.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can structure integrated listening, speaking, reading, and writing activities using a language education design framework reflecting real elementary classroom environments, systematically applying text analysis and expression strategies",
    "Learners can produce project outcomes reflecting industry-linked curriculum requirements and lifelong learning competencies, while integrating activities such as grammatical structure analysis, vocabulary expansion strategies, and context-based sentence construction.",
    "Learners can design a one-week learning plan using three or more language-learning apps (e.g., Duolingo, Memrise) in a smartphone environment, incorporating vocabulary memorization, pronunciation practice, and sentence construction. They can demonstrate feasibility and pedagogical effectiveness through peer evaluation and a teacher-verified checklist (meeting at least three of five criteria) and propose strategies to enhance reading comprehension and expressive skills."
