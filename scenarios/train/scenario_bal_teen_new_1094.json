  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic mobile device usage and understanding of social media platforms, foundational grammar and vocabulary knowledge, basic reading, writing, and speaking skills, and foundational understanding of scientific inquiry methods (observation, hypothesis formulation, experimental design)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Students perform language learning activities using personal devices, collaborating and sharing content via social media. Focuses on acquiring communication skills applicable to real-world settings (formal/informal expressions, understanding cultural contexts) as job seekers. Instructional design considers balanced development of reading, writing, and expressive skills, emphasizing systematic analysis of collected evidence (texts, feedback, participation data) to demonstrate educational effectiveness.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Cultivate scientific inquiry skills by observing text structures, vocabulary use, and cultural contexts of language learning content on mobile social media platforms (WeChat, Instagram, etc.) and critically evaluating them using a hypothesis-evidence-conclusion framework.",
    "Using case studies and qualitative methods (interviews, observations, etc.), learners design three language learning activities (integrating writing, reading, expression) via mobile social media (Instagram, TikTok, etc.) over 2–4 weeks, implement one activity in class based on peer/teacher feedback, and achieve ≥80% student engagement.",
    "Over a three-week mid-term course, learners use real-time feedback and collaboration tools on mobile platforms (Padlet, Google Classroom, etc.) to design three student-centered activities integrating grammar, vocabulary, and communication strategies. They develop strategies meeting ≥3.0/4.0 peer/teacher feedback criteria and measure effectiveness through controlled experimental designs."
