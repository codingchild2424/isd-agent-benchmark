  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic mobile device usage and social media platform comprehension, foundational grammar/vocabulary knowledge, simple text analysis capabilities, and elementary writing/reading skills",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Students perform language learning activities using personal devices, with collaboration and content sharing facilitated through social media. The program focuses on acquiring communication skills applicable to real-world settings (writing, presentation, critical reading) for job seekers. Customized strategies considering learners' language proficiency and cultural backgrounds are required in module design, with a particular emphasis on effective expression and reading strategies in multicultural environments.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will analyze text structures, vocabulary patterns, and cultural contexts of language learning content on mobile social media platforms (WeChat, Instagram, etc.) to develop critical reading skills.",
    "Using case studies and qualitative analysis methods (content analysis, learner interviews), learners will design one integrated reading-writing language education module based on Instagram/TikTok, incorporate peer feedback (≥3 peers) and instructor feedback (≥2 rounds), and submit a prototype within 3 weeks achieving ≥80% feasibility score (5-point scale).",
    "Within 4 weeks, learners will design 3 student-centered learning activities (group discussion, feedback-based writing, collaborative translation) using mobile social media platforms (Padlet, Slack) to enhance expressive (writing/presentation) and reading (critical reading) skills. They will develop strategies meeting ≥4 of 5 rubric criteria (creativity, interactivity, practicality, technology utilization, learning effectiveness) based on peer assessment (≥3 peers) and instructor review, and submit a final report (≤3 pages)."
