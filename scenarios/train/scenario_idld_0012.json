    "Learners can perform vector addition by progressing through the stages of concrete objects (model arrows) → semi-concrete objects (digital vector tools) → abstract symbols (coordinate notation).",
    "Learners can explain vector operations by connecting their geometric meaning (e.g., parallelogram law) with algebraic representations (component-wise calculations)."
