  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational pedagogy, language education theories (grammar/vocabulary systems/text type classification), and digital literacy. Additionally, experience with language learning assessment tools in mobile environments",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Enhances the ability to design language education (integrating reading, writing, speaking) by applying mobile learning theories and evaluation frameworks in smartphone-centric limited-technology environments. Particularly focuses on learner-customized vocabulary expansion strategies and grammar-integrated activity design, considering approaches for different text types (explanatory, argumentative, narrative texts).",

    "learner_age": "Teens (13-19)",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Based on the FRAME model and TDT theory, learners can systematically explain elements to consider when designing mobile language learning (grammar integration, vocabulary expansion, text type analysis) according to scientific inquiry procedures",
    "Learners can develop two or more language learning assessment tools applicable in smartphone environments (writing analysis apps, pronunciation evaluation tools) and propose reliability and validity verification plans for each tool",
    "Within one week, learners can submit one design proposal applying accessibility and engagement enhancement strategies using multiple representation methods (3 texts, 2 audios, 2 images) and interactive activities (1 quiz, 1 discussion) to actual language education cases (Duolingo, Quizlet). The proposal must meet over 80% of criteria in peer evaluation (3.5 or higher on a 5-point scale) and instructor feedback (3 or higher on a 4-point scale), particularly including reading comprehension, expression, and grammar application evaluation items"
