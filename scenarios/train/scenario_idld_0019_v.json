  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Secondary-level mathematics fundamentals (algebra, geometry, statistics) and basic pedagogical skills, understanding of mathematical problem-solving strategies. Prior learning experience in solving equations, interpreting graphs, calculating probabilities, and basic proof methods (e.g., induction) is required",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Simulation/VR-based",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course for pre-service/in-service teachers to strengthen instructional competencies. Provides experiential simulation environments for applying strategic thinking (problem decomposition, modeling, proof) in math lesson design. Utilizes VR tools to simulate real classroom scenarios, offering iterative strategy refinement. Integrates complex problem-solving and mathematical proof processes into simulations. Learners develop teaching competencies via activities like probability distribution analysis, equation visualization, and statistical data interpretation.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners analyze various types of mathematical problems (equations, graphs, statistics, etc.) in a simulation environment to design optimal instructional strategies and systematically structure problem-solving processes through mathematical modeling",
    "Learners evaluate their own teaching strategies (problem presentation methods, student error diagnosis, etc.) via real-time feedback in a VR-based environment and derive improvement plans including proof processes",
    "Learners collaborate with three in-company peer teachers in two simulation sessions, present problem-solving solutions applying four or more elements of a predefined strategic thinking framework (problem decomposition, modeling, proof, generalization, evaluation), and achieve an average score of 4+ (5-point scale) through peer evaluation. Instructional design skills utilizing statistical data interpretation and graph analysis abilities are particularly assessed"
