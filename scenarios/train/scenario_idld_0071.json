    "Learners can convert the three Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) items (eye response, verbal response, motor response) into mathematical modeling techniques (linear transformation, weighted scoring) and develop a digital assessment system prototype (simple web interface) within one week.",
    "Collaborating in teams of 3–4 for one week, learners can analyze two instructional design problems (e.g., UI optimization), apply a problem definition-solution derivation-evaluation process to write a two-page project report, and achieve a \"B\" (80+ points) grade in at least four out of five report evaluation rubric items."
