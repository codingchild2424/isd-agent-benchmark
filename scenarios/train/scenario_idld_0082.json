  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can collaboratively design a prototype incorporating linguistic interaction elements for a musical instrument learning service using the Activity Theory framework.",
    "Learners can use online collaboration tools like Figma or Miro to exchange real-time verbal feedback with two peers and a designer, producing a feedback document with five or more specific revision suggestions within one hour.",
    "Learners can complete a learning portfolio utilizing instrument-playing recording and sharing features in a BYOD environment and verbally explain musical expressions."
