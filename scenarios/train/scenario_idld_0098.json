  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Proficiency in secondary science curriculum content and basic PBL (Project-Based Learning) design experience, foundational understanding of socio-scientific issues (history, geography, politics, economics, culture), and experience in civic engagement education for community problem-solving",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Integrate project-based learning approaches for solving community issues, emphasizing offline group collaboration activities. Apply social science inquiry methods (evidence collection, analysis, conclusion drawing) and include discussions and decision-making activities to strengthen civic competencies.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Participants can use AI analysis tools to evaluate learners’ interaction patterns and social collaboration in PBL lesson design and integrate educational strategies for fostering citizenship.",
    "Participants can compare AI-generated videos (with/without preview) to explain criteria for selecting efficient teaching methods and propose implementation plans considering cultural diversity and community characteristics in educational settings.",
    "Participants can write two PBL scenario designs converting complex science concepts (e.g., climate change, gene editing) and submit them after achieving 3+ points per category (total 12+/16) on a peer evaluation rubric (goal clarity, realism, creativity, social relevance). Each scenario must explicitly incorporate civic engagement elements."
