Special emphasis is placed on ensuring reproducibility in experiments and objectivity in data interpretation",

    "Learners apply the five stages of action learning (problem definition, action planning, implementation, reflection, generalization) to solve real scientific problems, performing independent/dependent variable control and hypothesis verification while systematically analyzing experimental data.",
    "Learners enhance problem-solving competencies and derive evidence-based conclusions through collaborative feedback sharing with peers and cooperation on scientific inquiry methods (observation, measurement, analysis) using the LMS discussion board.",
    "Based on their action learning project experience during a one-week intensive course, learners must write a reflective journal of approximately 500 characters for each of the four stages of action learning (problem definition, planning, experimental design and implementation, reflection), and receive peer feedback averaging 3.5 or higher on a 5-point scale. The reflective journal must include error analysis during the experimental process and suggestions for improvement."
