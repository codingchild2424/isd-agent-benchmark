    "Within one week, learners apply biomolecular structure analysis data (e.g., protein 3D structures) from biochemistry, IT, and medical fields to visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI, represent them in three or more interactive charts (heatmaps, network graphs, 3D models), and achieve ≥80% scores in peer evaluation rubrics (clarity, accuracy, interactivity)"
