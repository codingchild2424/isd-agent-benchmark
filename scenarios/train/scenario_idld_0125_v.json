    "Learners can establish a three-stage action plan (problem diagnosis → solution design → evaluation) using AI-based scheduling tools (e.g., Google Calendar API, Notion templates) to address time management issues (e.g., delayed assignment submissions, reduced real-time class participation) in remote instruction and achieve over 80% satisfaction in peer evaluations and instructor feedback."
