    "By the end of the 6-month course, learners will define the five core elements of academic integrity (fairness, responsibility, honesty, respect, trustworthiness), develop and submit at least three practical implementation plans (including action guidelines, execution methods, and strategies to address potential obstacles) for each element across three workplace scenarios (e.g., assignment submission, collaboration, evaluation), and achieve a score of 80% or higher on the assessment rubric (20% clarity, 30% feasibility, 50% specificity).",
    "In a 4–5 member team, learners will demonstrate collaborative problem-solving competencies during a 6-week project-based assessment, achieving a score of 4 or higher (on a 5-point scale) in three out of four evaluation criteria (creativity, execution, collaboration, and outcome completeness) based on peer and instructor assessments."
