    "Learners improve basic numeracy problem-solving skills (ratios, budget calculations, etc.) by over 40% within six months through digital game-based economic simulations and understand economic concepts related to social resource distribution and civic rights.",
    "Learners apply three or more mathematical concepts (ratios, area, volume) to solve virtual city development budget management (5 million KRW budget) and spatial calculation (3D modeling tools) problems in PBL team projects (4–5 members), submit team deliverables (reports/prototypes), and achieve over 80% in four out of five rubric criteria (economic feasibility, creativity, collaboration, accuracy, completeness).",
    "Learners establish and execute self-directed learning plans using in-game feedback systems, enhancing data analysis skills for social problem-solving and civic engagement competencies."
