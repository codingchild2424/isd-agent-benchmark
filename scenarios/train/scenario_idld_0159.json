  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic ICT proficiency, secondary-level mathematics teaching experience, foundational understanding of mathematical concepts (equations, functions, geometry, etc.), and experience using graphing tools (e.g., Desmos) and equation editors (e.g., LaTeX).",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Pre-service and in-service teachers learn to develop, manage, reuse, and recontextualize mathematics educational materials using web-based tools. In a BYOD environment, project-based assessments strengthen digital instructional design and mathematical problem-solving competencies. Special emphasis is placed on mathematics-specific tools such as graph visualization (Desmos), formula editing (LaTeX), and statistical data analysis (Google Sheets), with evaluations focusing on proof construction and formula application during problem-solving.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Develop three or more learning objects for math domains (equations, functions, geometry) using web-based tools (Desmos, GeoGebra, etc.), applying graph visualization and formula-editing features.",
    "Recontextualize developed learning objects into two or more educational scenarios (e.g., concept exploration, problem-solving) and design data-driven feedback using statistical analysis tools.",
    "Verify the educational appropriateness and mathematical accuracy (formula application, proof processes, etc.) of project outputs through peer evaluation and self-reflection.",
    "Learners will classify mathematics learning materials (lecture notes, practice problems, solution files, graph data, etc.) from cloud-based storage into five or more folders and apply a three-tier tagging system (topic/difficulty/assessment type) to achieve a search accuracy rate of over 80% within three weeks. During this process, the metadata system for graph data and formula files will be optimized."
