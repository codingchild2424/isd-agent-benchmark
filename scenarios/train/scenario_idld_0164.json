    "After completing three engineering projects (bridge design, circuit assembly, fluid dynamics experiments) in virtual (PhET simulation) and physical laboratories (mechanical assembly kits), learners quantitatively analyze a mean score difference of 1.5 or more on a 5-point Likert scale participation survey between virtual and physical environments.",
    "They derive at least three learner motivation factors when designing virtual lab-based projects.",
    "In a 4-person team project, learners develop three evaluation criteria for individual contribution assessment—'number of idea proposals (≥5 times)', 'material preparation completeness (≥80%)', 'collaboration attitude (feedback implementation rate ≥70%)'—and achieve over 80% consensus (average ≥8/10 scale) among team members using the applied evaluation form.",
    "Over 80% of learners achieve the ability to apply engineering theory knowledge to virtual lab projects."
