    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational anatomy and physiology knowledge, basic physical therapy theory, understanding of medical terminology and language expressions related to patient education",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learners possess intermediate-level expertise and engage in asynchronous learning using digital devices. Formative assessments continuously monitor skill acquisition, while peer feedback sessions refine professional terminology and communication skills.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Through individual skill practice, learners explain the basic principles of three manual therapy techniques using professional terminology and present five linguistic expressions applicable to patient education.",
    "In a simulation environment applying continuous skill practice, learners perform at least four integrated treatment procedures and accurately generate oral instructions (e.g., \"Increase joint range of motion by 30%\") required at each stage.",
    "Learners analyze three case studies each of individual and continuous learning methods, compare cognitive load indicators (working memory usage, processing time, error rate), select one strategy aligned with their learning style diagnosis (visual/auditory/mixed), and verbally/written explain the rationale in at least three sentences."
