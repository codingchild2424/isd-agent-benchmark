  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic business concepts and entrepreneurial environments, and foundational knowledge in language education (grammar rules, vocabulary expansion techniques, reading comprehension strategies, writing practice for expressive skills enhancement)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",

    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A practice-oriented education program for current practitioners to strengthen entrepreneurial competencies within the language domain. Focuses on case studies applicable in practice, such as language learning material development (e.g., grammar visualization tools), educational platform operation (e.g., reading proficiency diagnostic systems), and pedagogical innovation (e.g., expression-centered project learning). Emphasizes integrating digital literacy and language education technology (EdTech).",

    "Based on entrepreneurial thinking, learners can propose three or more strategies for applying startup ideas to language education domains (grammar system analysis, vocabulary expansion strategies, reading-based content design, expression enhancement pedagogies)",
    "Using Canva or Google Slides, learners can design one language education-related business model, produce a 10-minute pitch deck, and score 4 or higher in each of four peer evaluation rubric items (content organization, creativity, feasibility, delivery) (totaling 12 or higher out of 16). The pitch deck must include specific implementation plans such as language learning material development (e.g., customized vocabulary books) or educational platform operation (e.g., AI-based reading training systems)",
    "In blended learning environments, learners can propose five or more practical improvement plans for peers’ startup proposals through peer review. The improvement plans must reflect domain-specific elements such as language education content design (e.g., gamification of grammar), learner-adaptive teaching methods (e.g., leveled reading strategies), and digital tool utilization (e.g., vocabulary learning apps)"
