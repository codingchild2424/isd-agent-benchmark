    "Learners can design three or more scientific inquiry modules (including hypothesis formulation, control of independent/dependent variables, experimental data analysis) using advanced LMS features (quizzes, discussion boards, feedback systems), achieve over 80% suitability in peer review and expert evaluation, and implement them in actual classes within four weeks",
    "Learners can analyze LMS log data (gender, academic achievement top 20%/middle 60%/bottom 20%, scientific thinking assessment scores) to design three or more customized educational strategies (content recommendation algorithms, interaction frequency adjustments, evidence-based feedback types) optimized for four learner types and achieve an average of 4 or higher on a 5-point expert panel evaluation scale",
    "Learners can design plans to apply three or more self-regulated learning (SRL) skills (goal setting, self-monitoring, strategy adjustment) using LMS-based formative assessment tools and improve scientific analysis skills (experimental data collection, hypothesis verification, conclusion drawing) to 4 or higher (out of 5) based on a 5-level rubric"
