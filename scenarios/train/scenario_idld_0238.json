Learners systematically acquire mathematical modeling competencies, including state-space model design (differential equation transformations), matrix optimization (Riccati equations, eigenvalue optimization), and control system performance analysis (numerical proofs, error calculations). Particularly maximize learning effectiveness through graph-based visualization (state trajectories, performance metric comparisons).",

    "Explain the mathematical principles of a reinforcement learning-based LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) controller (differential equations, matrix optimization, cost function minimization) and implement the Riccati equation solution and matrix optimization process via simulation.",
    "Within three weeks, learners can represent the dynamics of a multi-axis system (e.g., robotic joint system) as a second-order differential equation-based state-space model (continuous/discrete time), design a 3×3 coupled cognitive interaction matrix, simulate it in MATLAB/Simulink, and achieve over 90% model accuracy by applying eigenvalue analysis, state feedback control, and optimization techniques.",
    "Apply a decoupling policy optimization algorithm to quantitatively evaluate performance metrics (e.g., settling time, overshoot, control error reduction rate) of a three-axis control system and calculate control error reduction rates through numerical proofs (matrix norm calculations, convergence analysis)."
