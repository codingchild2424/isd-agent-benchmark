    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learners possess intermediate expertise in the language domain (academic writing, complex text comprehension, presentation expression) and are evaluated on their ability to design CLO schemas and verify language learning effectiveness through project-based assessments. Includes real-time collaboration (Google Docs, Padlet) and text-based communication activities (chat, forums) using personal devices (BYOD).",

    "Apply relational knowledge structuring strategies (schema mapping, concept linking) for cognitive load optimization to STEM language learning scenarios, enhancing academic expression and complex text comprehension.",
    "Through team-based projects, learners develop language learning instructional design solutions reflecting three CLOs (grammar accuracy, vocabulary diversity, discourse coherence). They submit reports demonstrating language learning effectiveness (≥4/5 on evaluation scale) and communication skill improvement (≥20% pre-post test gains) via peer review and expert evaluation."
