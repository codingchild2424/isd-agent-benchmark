    "Learners can design a peer feedback system using online collaboration tools like Padlet or Google Jamboard, apply three or more emotional safety strategies (e.g., positive language, anonymous feedback options, shared feedback guidelines), and clearly explain the case to over 80% of peer evaluators.",
    "Learners propose personalized learning interface optimization strategies by applying a customizable LX (Learner Experience) design framework."
