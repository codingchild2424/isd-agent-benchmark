  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Organizational management and educational planning experience, basic understanding of instructional theories, foundational awareness of social relationships, civic consciousness, and organizational culture, and cultural diversity recognition",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",

    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A customized training program for corporate university administrators to strengthen leadership competencies, aiming to foster social responsibility and civic awareness. It utilizes VR simulation content and mobile learning platforms implementable in smartphone-centric, limited-technology environments. The curriculum considers political and economic changes, cultural diversity, and includes strategies for enhancing community relations.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Applying cognitive load theory, learners can break down and deliver complex educational scenarios step-by-step, considering social relationships and cultural diversity contexts.",
    "Through knowledge co-construction activities with peers in VR-based simulations, learners can develop effective leadership strategies and organizational culture improvement plans, while exploring practical measures to realize civic consciousness and social responsibility.",
    "Over a 6-month course, learners can analyze formative assessment feedback (quizzes, surveys, discussion participation) provided at least three times to propose at least two actionable improvement plans for the instructional design process (e.g., content restructuring, diversifying assessment methods), implement these plans in an actual educational program, and achieve at least 80% positive response rates in learner satisfaction surveys and a 10% or greater improvement in pre-post assessment scores related to civic consciousness."
