    "Learners can apply at least two chemistry principles to real-life problems (e.g., new material design) based on simulation experiment results.",
    "Over four weeks, learners conduct team projects (3–4 members) to derive trend prediction models with over 85% accuracy by analyzing given simulation data (e.g., differential equation-based models). They write a 3-page A4 report and achieve at least 14 out of 20 points on the report evaluation rubric (data interpretation, analytical methodology, results presentation, team collaboration)."
