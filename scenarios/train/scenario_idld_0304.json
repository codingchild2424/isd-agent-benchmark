  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic mathematical concepts (numbers, shapes, measurement, formula calculations), general knowledge of early childhood developmental stages (cognitive and motor development), and ability to solve simple equations and interpret graphs",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Designing early childhood mathematics education methods using motion-interactive games (touch/gesture recognition) in smartphone-based limited-technology environments. Focus on developing low-cost solutions applicable to real classroom settings, including simple pre- and post-assessment tools (e.g., number card sorting tests, shape composition tasks) to measure educational effectiveness. Learning activities incorporate probabilistic elements (e.g., dice games) and statistical analysis (e.g., pattern frequency measurement) to enhance engagement.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Design multimodal learning stations to develop at least three computational and geometric activities for preschoolers’ number sense development (number recognition, quantity comparison, pattern identification) and spatial reasoning (shape construction, positional relationships, geometric property analysis).",
    "Learners can create three math education scenarios for young children (ages 3-6) using smartphone-based movement interaction games (e.g., Number Jump—applying addition/subtraction formulas, Shape Matching—analyzing symmetry and transformations) and submit a practical report achieving an average score of 4 or higher on a 5-point rubric (25% creativity, 35% educational effectiveness, 40% technology utilization) through peer evaluation.",
    "Learners can analyze the educational effectiveness (numeracy improvement, problem-solving skills, engagement) of three vocational math learning stations according to project-based assessment criteria (30% participation, 30% creativity, 40% completion quality) and write a 3-page A4 report (introduction-analysis-conclusion structure)."
