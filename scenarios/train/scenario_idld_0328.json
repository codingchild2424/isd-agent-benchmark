    "By participating three or more times in collaborative problem-solving (CPS) processes for social issues using online chat tools, learners analyze cognitive, metacognitive, and socio-communicative patterns.",
    "Learners classify conflict situations in CPS into two types (e.g., time-lag/asynchronous conflict, spatial/role conflict) and propose one or more suitable resolution strategies per type.",
    "Learners understand the principles of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and apply its simplified form (e.g., similarity calculations on time/space axes) to visualize collaborative patterns."
