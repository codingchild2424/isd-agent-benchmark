  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Subject matter expertise in science (core concepts in physics, chemistry, and biology) and foundational pedagogical knowledge, understanding of scientific inquiry methods (experimental design, data analysis, hypothesis testing), and proficiency in variable control and evidence-based analysis",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Blended learning",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A blended learning program combining smartphone-based mobile learning with face-to-face workshops, providing a flexible learning environment tailored to working professionals. Particularly, virtual lab simulations via mobile platforms are combined with actual lab observations in face-to-face workshops to enhance the practical applicability of science education. Learners experience the scientific inquiry process (hypothesis setting → measurement → analysis → conclusion) in mobile environments and practice variable control and evidence-based analysis in face-to-face workshops, achieving integration of theory and practice.",

    "Learners can integrate Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) and Pedagogical Pedagogical Knowledge (PPK) to propose 3 experiment/observation-centered lesson designs emphasizing variable control, providing evidence meeting ≥4 of 5 evaluation criteria (clarity, feasibility, educational impact, creativity, scientific accuracy) per design.",
    "Learners can design 2 PPK-PCK-integrated teaching strategies for actual classroom settings (e.g., secondary science) within 4 weeks and submit executable lesson plans meeting ≥4 of 5 expert/peer review criteria (content accuracy, pedagogical appropriateness, variable control, evidence-based analysis, scientific inquiry reflection).",
    "Learners can improve ≥2 knowledge integration strategies based on peer feedback, design a 3+step lesson implementation plan reflecting the scientific inquiry process (hypothesis→measurement→analysis→conclusion), and submit a final report meeting ≥4 of 5 rubric criteria (inquiry reflection, evidence utilization, variable control, educational effectiveness, creativity)."
