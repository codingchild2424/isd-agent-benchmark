  "title": "Strengthening Scientific Inquiry-Based Science Education Design through Informal Learning: Focused on Experimentation, Observation, and Evidence Analysis",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of foundational science education concepts and mastery of basic experimental design principles (variables, measurement, observation). Particularly, the ability to distinguish between independent, dependent, and controlled variables, along with experience in basic data analysis (graphs, tables).",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A structured process for general citizens without science education design experience, systematically delivering informal learning strategies naturally acquired in daily work environments. Activities center on the scientific inquiry process (observation, hypothesis, experiment, analysis, conclusion). Special focus on low-cost experimental designs performable in everyday spaces (e.g., using recycled materials) and methods for deriving evidence-based conclusions (e.g., comparative data analysis)",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Identify three or more informal learning cases (hypothesis setting, experimental design, evidence analysis) to solve variable control issues in everyday science education activities and clearly present measurement tools and observation methods.",
    "Within one week, learners collaborate with peer learners to co-develop one educational design case reflecting the scientific inquiry process (problem definition, hypothesis setting, experimental design, data analysis, conclusion), submit it to an online collaboration platform, and receive peer feedback averaging 4 or higher on a 5-point scale. At this time, independent variables, dependent variables, and control variables must be clearly distinguished in the experimental design.",
    "Without organizational support, learners outline a five-stage process for developing individual scientific problem-solving competencies (observation → hypothesis → experiment → analysis → conclusion) and specify scientific inquiry methods (e.g., systematic observation, variable-controlled experiments) for each stage."
