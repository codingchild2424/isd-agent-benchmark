  "title": "Academic Library Information Search Education: Strategies for Social Science Research Material Navigation and Civic Competency Development",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic understanding of smartphone usage, general information retrieval experience, foundational knowledge of social science topics (history/geography/politics), and basic awareness of civic institutions and rights",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learners primarily access the LMS via smartphones, with self-directed learning required in non-real-time environments. Materials must be provided in mobile-friendly formats optimized for social science research, including case studies reflecting diverse social science contexts (e.g., multicultural policy comparisons, climate change and geographical impacts, democratic development processes). Additionally, learners must cultivate critical thinking and evidence-based analysis skills as citizens during the information search process.",

    "learner_age": "40s and above",
    "learner_education": "Adult learner (non-degree)",
    "learner_role": "Student",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners accurately interpret at least 80% of social science documents (e.g., historical records, geographical statistics, political analysis reports) explaining online academic database search procedures.",
    "Learners successfully search for academic materials on specific social science topics (e.g., history-industrialization process, geography-population migration, politics-policy changes) at least three times using the provided search guide and analyze the cultural and institutional contexts of the materials.",
    "Based on a week-long experience using document-based guides (e.g., library manuals, online FAQs) in social science information searches, learners write and submit a reflective log including: 1) two improvements for search efficiency (e.g., keyword selection strategies, material evaluation criteria), 2) one plan for applying social science research (e.g., community issue analysis project), and 3) one civic application strategy (e.g., policy proposal writing)."
