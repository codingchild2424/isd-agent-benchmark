  "title": "Enhancing Critical Language Skills and Higher-Order Thinking Through Structured Online Discussions: Strengthening Argumentation, Analysis, and Textual Expression",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic language communication skills (grammar, vocabulary, text interpretation) and experience adapting to online discussion environments, understanding of diverse sentence structures, foundational proficiency in academic writing and critical reading",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Emphasizes discussion activities in offline environments using digital tools. Project-based assessments holistically evaluate writing, reading, and expression skills, targeting integrated development of critical thinking and linguistic fluency. Analyzes discussion-generated texts for argument structure, lexical diversity, and grammatical accuracy.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can enhance the accuracy and logical consistency of language expression by utilizing four message types—argumentation, critique, evidence presentation, and explanation—in structured online discussions and apply vocabulary and grammatical structures appropriate for various text types.",
    "Learners can achieve all five levels of Bloom’s cognitive domain (understanding, application, analysis, evaluation, synthesis) during discussions, generating clear text expressions by utilizing academic vocabulary and complex sentence structures suitable for each stage.",
    "Learners can apply strategies to generate high-order thinking responses (e.g., counterexamples, inference expansion, logical fallacy identification) to peers’ argumentative or critical messages, convey them through clear text expressions, and construct rebuttal structures considering the opponent’s perspective."
