  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Advanced-level mathematical knowledge (algebra, geometry, statistics, probability), basic understanding of multicultural societies, foundational skills in mathematical proof structures, and graph interpretation abilities",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "In the New Zealand higher education context, strengthening competencies in mathematics education design that harmonizes Māori and Western cultures. Special emphasis is placed on developing case studies combining traditional mathematical formulas with Te Ao Māori's nature observation methods for graph interpretation, probability modeling, and statistical analysis. The goal is to cultivate problem-solving and data visualization skills reflecting cultural contexts.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Participants can create a bicultural mathematics lesson design framework reflecting dual cultural principles within a 4-hour workshop and propose equation-solving/graph interpretation approaches accounting for cultural variables.",
    "Participants can identify ≥80% of decolonization-oriented mathematics content critique criteria (cultural fairness, historical context of formulas, social implications of probability modeling).",
    "Participants can analyze New Zealand’s sustainability strategies (Zero Carbon Bill statistical modeling, Kaitiakitanga geometric representation) in 4-person group activities, create 1 design proposal (equations/graphs/statistics) reflecting Māori bicultural principles (Te Ao Māori), and deliver a 10-minute presentation scoring ≥3/5 on peer evaluation."
