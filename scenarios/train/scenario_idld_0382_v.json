    "Over a mid-term course (4 weeks), learners analyze three potential workplace problems (e.g., scheduling, data categorization, simple automation), design algorithms to solve them using block-based programming tools (e.g., Scratch), and express them as pseudocode or flowcharts with five or more steps.",
    "In teams of three, learners collaboratively develop a computer science-based prototype (e.g., a simple game or calculator app) within two weeks and submit a result that meets four or more of the five functional verification checklist items provided by the teacher/mentor.",
    "Learners analyze given scientific experiment data (minimum 10 samples) using digital tools like Google Sheets or Excel, visualize it as bar or line graphs, and derive three or more meaningful conclusions about experimental conditions based on the analysis."
