    "Learners can collaborate within groups to design mathematical approaches for solving real-life problems (e.g., budget planning, measurement).",
    "Learners can identify and correct at least two errors discovered during the problem-solving process through communication with team members.",
    "Based on project deliverables, learners create a 5-minute oral presentation and A3-sized poster or under-3-minute video visuals, achieving an average of 4+ points per item (9+/12 total) on a peer evaluation rubric (3 items: content delivery, creativity, visual impact, 5-point scale). This goal is assessed in the final project presentation at the 6-month course conclusion, with two interim feedback opportunities (at 3rd and 5th months) for improvement"
