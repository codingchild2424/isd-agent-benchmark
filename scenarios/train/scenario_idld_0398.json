    "prior_knowledge": "Basic knowledge of radiation oncology or medical physics, fundamental radiation therapy principles, scientific methodologies (hypothesis formulation, observation, experimental design), and foundational medical imaging analysis",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Conducted as smartphone-based scientific microlearning with formative assessments providing real-time feedback. Designed for working professionals, this course integrates theory and clinical application, emphasizing scientific inquiry processes (observation, hypothesis formulation, data analysis, conclusion). Cultivates clinical decision-making through experimental data interpretation and variable control training.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners accurately identify 3D anatomical structures in radiation therapy planning using scientific inquiry methods, systematically analyze experimental data, and derive evidence-based conclusions.",
    "Learners can distinguish tumors and surrounding structures in CT/MRI images with 90% accuracy and establish scientific analysis and evidence-based treatment strategies based on quantitative measurement results.",
    "Learners can collaborate with radiation oncologists, medical physicists, and radiation technologists to design patient-specific radiation therapy plans within 2 hours using 3D simulation software (e.g., RayStation), create simulation reports meeting coverage of ≥95% for target areas and radiation dose to surrounding tissues <5%, and validate scientific validity by applying variable control and data analysis techniques."
