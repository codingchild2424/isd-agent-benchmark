    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Project-based learning (PBL)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Students engage in a language processing model design project to solve real-world social issues (language barriers, cultural biases, etc.), cultivating the ability to comprehensively analyze technology-society interactions. Using collaboration tools (Zoom, Miro, GitHub) in a BYOD environment, teams conduct text data collection and refinement while incorporating linguistic considerations (dialect variations, cultural metaphors). Final outputs must include strategies for optimizing reading and expression in multilingual contexts.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners analyze the impact of data scientists' subjectivity on language processing model design through three case studies. In a 5-page report (introduction-body-conclusion structure with references), they document three or more key influencing factors and improvement strategies, diagnosing model bias using linguistic concepts like morpheme and syntax analysis.",
    "Identify three or more social factors (cultural context, linguistic diversity, ethical frameworks) to consider when designing language processing systems suitable for specific social contexts (multicultural/multilingual environments). Additionally, analyze how differences in vocabulary and grammar systems affect model performance.",
    "Within one week, learners analyze the explainability of language models for two or more multilingual datasets through project deliverables (reports/demos). Using fairness verification tools (e.g., Fairness Indicators), they propose three bias management strategies and evaluate cultural appropriateness and expressive diversity in text generation."
