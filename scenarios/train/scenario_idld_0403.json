  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Master’s degree or higher, foundational knowledge of research methodologies, professional practical experience, basic academic writing and literature analysis skills, understanding of basic grammar and text analysis experience",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "An intensive workshop where professionals collaboratively master the academic paper writing process via cohort models. Focuses on language-centric research skills: scholarly text analysis (vocabulary, structure, expression evaluation), research design framework comparisons, and expressive enhancement through peer feedback. Aims to cultivate academic communication and critical evaluation of scholarly texts.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Based on academic terminology and research framework analysis with cohort members, learners can create a step-by-step roadmap from paper topic selection to data analysis. Especially, apply text-based critical thinking when clarifying research questions, designing methodologies, and selecting analytical tools",
    "Using an integrated paper guidance model (LLM) like GPT-4, learners analyze (1) five core elements (research questions, methodology, analytical tools) of research design frameworks across three papers, (2) create a comparative table structured along three axes (research purpose, data collection methods, result measurement criteria), and (3) derive three or more limitations (sample size, data bias, generalizability, etc.) in result interpretation. Additionally, (4) critically evaluate the text structure (introduction-methods-results-discussion) and lexical patterns (academic term frequency, passive voice ratio, appropriateness of jargon) of research papers using a 5-point rubric",
    "Develop strategies to optimize time management and workload based on peer feedback and instructor support, and apply effective expression techniques in academic writing (clear thesis construction, logical connectors, passive voice alternatives)"
