    "Developing the ability to design mathematics instruction that visualizes concepts and solves equations and functions using digital tools (interactive content, AI-based analytics, etc.) in blended learning environments",
    "Developing three or more mathematics teaching strategies based on neuroscience-driven learning principles (attention, working memory, executive function, emotional regulation) (e.g., step-by-step equation-solving strategies based on cognitive load theory, graph pattern recognition training, working memory optimization strategies for statistical data interpretation)",
    "Collaboratively producing two or more mathematics curriculum improvement proposals through a Professional Learning Community (PLC) cooperative design process (e.g., enhancing graph transformation activities when reorganizing function units, adding visualization steps to geometric proof processes)",
    "Designing and implementing a learner-adaptive feedback system by analyzing formative assessment data (quizzes, observation records, etc.) (e.g., applying algorithms for analyzing individual error patterns, building a database of common error types in probability problem-solving)"
