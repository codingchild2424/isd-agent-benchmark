    "prior_knowledge": "Completion of advanced coursework and substantial professional experience in specialized fields. Proficient in basic grammatical systems and context-appropriate vocabulary for academic/professional settings. Some experience in pragmatic expression selection based on contextual factors",

    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A non-face-to-face language education environment requiring active learner interaction. It comprehensively enhances expressive skills (pragmatic appropriateness, lexical diversity) and reading comprehension (discourse cohesion understanding, contextual inference) through parallel text-based and voice-based communication activities.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can complete language projects (e.g., role-plays, presentation materials) in collaboration with peers after a six-month course, using expressions appropriate to the target language’s pragmatic context (considering social situations and audience).",
    "Learners engage in real-time collaborative sessions (3+ times) using Google Docs and Padlet, exchanging opinions with 2+ peers, and apply discourse cohesion and appropriate vocabulary selection in a 10-minute integrated listening-speaking activity (topic presentation + feedback).",
    "Learners evaluate 3 peer language tasks (presentations, essays, etc.) using a 3-step feedback routine (structure-content-expression rubric), proposing ≥2 specific improvement suggestions (grammatical accuracy, lexical diversity, discourse structure) per task, and receive ≥80% actionable feedback from peers. Evaluation criteria include vocabulary choice, grammatical accuracy, discourse cohesion, and pragmatic appropriateness."
