    "Learners can implement an intelligent agent simulation in Unity (C# scripting) applying three core OOP concepts, submit deliverables meeting at least six of eight peer-reviewed and instructor-verified checklist items, and enhance logical expression and technical writing skills through code comments and documentation.",
    "Developing the ability to convert procedural problem-solving processes into verbal and visual representations (flowcharts, pseudocode, technical reports) while improving algorithm design and debugging skills in activity-based learning environments.",
    "Cultivating problem-solving skills through code reviews and peer evaluations using collaboration tools, while strengthening technical communication abilities (technical writing, code documentation, evaluation reporting)."
