    "Learners achieve over 80% accuracy in monthly tourist demand forecasting for destinations using Python-based AI analysis models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM), propose at least three resource allocation plans (staff/facilities) based on predictions, and write a report meeting at least four of five institutional evaluation checklist items.",
    "Learners analyze over ten datasets of tourist visitor data using Python-based big data tools (Pandas, Tableau, etc.), then write a 5+-page tourism marketing strategy report reflecting data insights. The report must score at least 4/5 points across five institutional evaluation criteria (goal setting, data utilization, creativity, etc.).",
    "Learners understand data privacy protection techniques and apply them to the analysis process."
