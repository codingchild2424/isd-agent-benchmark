  "learning_goals": [
    "In neonatal resuscitation simulation scenarios, learners perform standard protocols (initial assessment, airway maintenance, breathing support) with 90% accuracy and provide clear verbal instructions and feedback within the team.",
    "In team-based emergency situations, learners improve communication efficiency to reduce decision-making time by 30% and clearly document role allocation.",
    "Learners describe in a 3-page self-assessment report how their responsibility and emotional regulation abilities affected two real-life resuscitation cases and write a structured report meeting at least four of five evaluation rubric criteria."
