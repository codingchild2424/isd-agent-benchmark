    "Explain methods for integrating gamification elements (points, levels, rewards) into early childhood cognitive activity design",
    "Over three weeks, learners can implement a Python-based system that automatically adjusts the difficulty of physics simulation content to three levels (beginner/intermediate/advanced) using a reaction-based difficulty adjustment algorithm and, after testing with 10 users, write an evaluation report achieving over 80% satisfaction (average 4+ points on a 5-point scale).",
    "Learners will develop one digital learning module, proposable to early childhood education institutions, through a 3-week project-based assessment, meeting the following criteria: (1) Content structure appropriate for early childhood developmental stages (sensorimotor and preoperational stages), (2) Implementation of three or more interactive elements (e.g., drag-and-drop, voice recognition, touch interaction), (3) Incorporation of a mobile/tablet-compatible technical environment (HTML5/CSS3/JS-based). The developed module must achieve 80+ points on an expert evaluation rubric (30% content appropriateness, 40% technical implementation, 30% interaction diversity).",
    "Within 4 weeks, learners will collect and analyze quantitative data (5 metrics: click-through rate, usage time, error rate, etc.) and qualitative data (10+ user feedbacks) on interaction effects of a prototype running on tablet devices (iPad standard), and produce a 3-page analysis report."
