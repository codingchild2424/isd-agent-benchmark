    "Explain the five core roles of remote language education instructors (content developer, interaction facilitator, feedback provider, assessment designer, technology integrator) and diagnose role-specific competency gaps in language education (e.g., grammar/vocabulary integration, reading/writing assessment design).",
    "Learners can analyze survey data (minimum 50 responses) to derive five priority areas for developing competencies in digital tool utilization and language education design (e.g., grammar/vocabulary integration, reading/writing assessment) and present weighted results using the AHP hierarchical analysis method.",
    "Design three mobile-optimized language teaching methods (microlearning-based vocabulary training, pronunciation assessment using speech recognition, writing feedback via collaboration platforms) and apply them to project-based assessments (text analysis, expression evaluation, etc.)."
