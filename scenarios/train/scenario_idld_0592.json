  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic art theory and design principles, foundational understanding of scientific inquiry methods (hypothesis formulation–experimental design–variable control), and experience with digital measurement tools",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Online learning for pre-service/in-service teachers in smartphone-centric limited-technology environments. Learners analyze structural characteristics of artworks using scientific analysis tools (measurement, graphing), explore creative expression methods in digital environments, and draw evidence-based conclusions.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can apply three or more foundational art techniques (sketching, color theory, digital drawing) using digital tools to the process of scientific observation, measurement, and experimentation.",
    "Learners develop the ability to design instruction based on the TPACK framework (integrating technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge) and create educational activities that incorporate variable control and evidence-based assessment.",
    "Learners complete art education projects executable in mobile environments (portfolio creation, virtual exhibition planning) while applying data analysis and creative problem-solving processes."
