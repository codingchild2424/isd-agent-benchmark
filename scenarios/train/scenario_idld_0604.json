    "Learners can orally explain core reinforcement learning concepts (MDP, agent, reward function) within 3 minutes, present two scenarios applicable to medical data (e.g., patient treatment records), and describe three or more considerations when designing reward functions for each scenario.",
    "A pipeline is built to preprocess diabetic patient data and convert it into input formats for reinforcement learning models.",
    "Learners can implement a simple treatment recommendation model (decision tree or linear regression-based) in Python that reflects medical constraints (e.g., drug interactions, patient allergy information) and apply performance evaluation methods achieving 80%+ accuracy and 0.75+ F1-score."
