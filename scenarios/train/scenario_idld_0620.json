  "title": "Interdisciplinary Service Learning in Biochemistry and Biology: Mobile-Based Language-Integrated Short-Term Intensive Course",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic biochemistry and biology knowledge, foundational laboratory skills, and introductory understanding of scientific writing (lab reports, abstracts) and presentations. Basic ability to translate technical terminology into everyday language.",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "A job-linked service-learning project where participants engage in solving real-world industry problems, with a focus on training communication skills (writing explanatory texts, presentations, visual materials) for conveying technical content to non-experts. Particular emphasis is placed on linguistically reconstructing scientific data and cultivating the ability to explain specialized terminology to the general public.",
    "institution_type": "Corporate/Enterprise",
    "learner_age": "In their 30s",
    "learner_education": "High school",
    "learner_role": "Office worker (administrative/management)",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will develop language expression skills to quantitatively describe hormone concentrations in biological samples using ELISA (biochemical analysis method) in scientific texts (lab reports, abstracts) with clarity.",
    "Learners will collaborate with service recipient institutions to create a portfolio (reports, presentation materials, infographics) that effectively communicates research findings to non-technical stakeholders, refining communication skills to translate complex concepts into everyday language.",
    "Learners will create a three-step action plan applicable to job settings (call centers/customer support departments) based on knowledge acquired through reciprocal service learning (e.g., customer interaction skills, problem-solving frameworks). The plan will incorporate at least five professional terms (e.g., CSAT, FMEA) and be structured logically (problem definition → solution → expected effects), strengthening the ability to articulate technical content clearly for non-experts."
