    "Learners can collaborate with multidisciplinary teams of 3–5 members over 4 weeks following the PBL (Problem-Based Learning) process (problem definition → planning → implementation → evaluation) to develop a project proposal (5+ pages) and implementation plan (including timeline) for addressing community issues, present for 10 minutes at a final showcase, incorporate at least three feedback items from an expert panel, and submit a final report.",
    "Learners can establish three measurable social impact metrics (e.g., energy savings, participant satisfaction, community awareness change rate) as outcomes of a science project within 4 weeks, collect quantitative data (%) or qualitative assessments (5-point Likert scale) for each metric, and compile a report."
