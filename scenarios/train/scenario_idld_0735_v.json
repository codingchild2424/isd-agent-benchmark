    "Learners apply information design principles (visual hierarchy, color contrast, bullet-point usage) when creating slides and produce visual materials that achieve over 80% success rate in a user test (10 participants) evaluating core content recognition within 5 seconds for three slide samples.",
    "Learners can communicate while maintaining a 7:3 balance between verbal elements (content delivery) and nonverbal elements (eye contact, gestures, slide utilization) during presentations."
