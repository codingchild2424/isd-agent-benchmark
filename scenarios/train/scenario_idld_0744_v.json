    "Learners select one gender-specific STEM topic (e.g., robotics for females, data science for males) from three options, conduct a 4-week inquiry, submit a computer science project, and achieve ≥4 points (5-point scale) in a satisfaction survey to confirm sustained interest.",
    "Learners use digital tools (sensors, data analysis software) to select one real-world problem (e.g., energy conservation, safety management), divide the solution process into five stages (problem definition, data collection, analysis, solution design, evaluation), and complete a 5–10-page project report or 10-minute presentation."
