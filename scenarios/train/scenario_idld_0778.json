  "title": "Language-Integrated Blended Instructional Development Program for Strengthening Engineering Education Teaching Competencies: Enhancing Technical Documentation and Academic Expression Skills",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Bachelor’s degree or higher in engineering education or relevant practical experience, foundational language skills (vocabulary, grammar, reading comprehension, writing) required for technical documentation and academic communication",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A course aimed at developing practical teaching competencies for engineering education faculty, combining mobile-based microlearning in a BYOD environment with field-linked activities in a blended program. It includes language expression training (text analysis, writing, presentations) for clearly conveying complex engineering concepts and technical documentation workshops. Special emphasis is placed on using specialized terminology and strengthening explanatory skills for non-technical audiences.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Participants apply engineering education curriculum design methodologies to draft one course design proposal and enhance communication skills by utilizing clear expression, technical terminology, and grammatical accuracy in technical documentation.",
    "Participants develop at least three practical training materials reflecting advanced manufacturing technologies in industrial settings, integrating precise linguistic expression, visual aids, and chart utilization required for technical explanations.",
    "Participants select three formative assessment tools (quizzes, discussion forums, surveys) based on an LMS (Learning Management System), design evaluation rubrics for each course, apply them to a real learning environment within two weeks, and achieve over 80% positive feedback from participants. Specifically, academic expression, feedback writing skills, and critical thinking must be demonstrated in discussion forums."
