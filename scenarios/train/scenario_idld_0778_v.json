  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Expert-level knowledge and complex problem-solving experience, engineering field basic vocabulary and technical text interpretation skills, understanding of fundamental language education design principles.",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Conducted in a limited technological environment centered on smartphones, focusing on developing language teaching competencies applicable in the field. Particularly emphasizes strengthening the ability to utilize engineering field-specific terminology and translate technical documents, including strategies for improving learners' reading comprehension, expressive skills, and context-based vocabulary acquisition.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Participants will systematically apply curriculum design and evaluation methods in engineering fields to develop a language education program with logical text structures and specialized terminology proficiency.",
    "Participants will establish self-directed learning strategies using MOOCs and online platforms to enhance integrated teaching competencies in reading/writing and text-based communication skills in engineering fields.",
    "Participants will apply practice-oriented educational methods in industry-linked projects (e.g., AI-based translation system development) and submit deliverables meeting language-related key performance indicators (KPIs) such as 90% technical document translation accuracy and user feedback incorporation.",
    "Participants will design and implement effective teaching strategies (e.g., flipped learning, blended learning) for one or more language education programs in a hybrid learning environment (online+offline), achieving learner engagement of 80% or higher and evaluation scores of 4.0/5.0 or above, and submit a report of five or more pages reflecting implementation results.",
    "Participants will collaborate with three or more domestic/international professional institutions, participate in two workshops for curriculum development planning, prepare one needs analysis report per institution, and submit a draft language education roadmap executable within six months. The roadmap must achieve 4 points or higher in three out of four expert panel evaluation criteria (5-point scale)."
