  "title": "Scientific Inquiry Competency Enhancement Program for Communicating Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Concepts in an Accessible Manner",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding fundamental concepts in biochemistry and molecular biology (experimental design, variable control, data analysis), secondary-level or higher life science knowledge, and basic comprehension of the scientific inquiry process (hypothesis formulation, experimentation, observation, conclusion drawing)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "For mid-level professionals (medical/legal/technical) with intermediate biochemistry/molecular biology knowledge, in smartphone-based limited-technology environments. Learners focus on translating scientific concepts into everyday language, with recommended content creation using real experimental cases. Particularly emphasize measurable variables and evidence-based analysis.",
    "institution_type": "University (undergraduate)",
    "learner_age": "In their 20s",
    "learner_education": "Elementary",
    "learner_role": "Student",
    "domain_expertise": "Beginner"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can prepare a 3-minute presentation explaining biochemical concepts (e.g., enzyme-catalyzed reactions, DNA replication) in language tailored to three audiences (family, friends, general public), achieving 4+ points (out of 5) in at least two rubric categories (clarity, appropriateness, engagement) from peer evaluations. The process must emphasize evidence-based explanations with experimental data and variable analysis.",
    "Within one week, learners can select a molecular/biochemical mechanism (e.g., insulin resistance, DNA repair) and produce a 3-minute news-style content piece (text script + audio/video) achieving 4+ points (out of 5) on a public-friendly evaluation rubric (clarity, engagement, scientific accuracy). The content must reflect variable control, experimental approaches, and emphasize observable phenomena and measurable data.",
    "Learners can select three core biochemistry concepts (e.g., enzyme catalysis, cellular respiration), develop a simplified instructional guide (10 pages) and assessment tools (5+ items) for middle/high school students, and achieve 3+ points (out of 4) on a peer evaluation rubric (clarity, scientific accuracy, educational suitability). The guide must include two activities reflecting scientific inquiry methods (observation, hypothesis, experimental design) and incorporate hypothesis verification and data analysis processes."
