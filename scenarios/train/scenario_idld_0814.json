  "learning_goals": [
    "Analyze technical characteristics of generative AI and propose three or more application strategies for science instructional design.",
    "Apply Grounded Theory methodology to derive five or more barriers to GenAI adoption in educational settings.",
    "Learners create one scientific inquiry activity design document executable in limited technological environments using smartphone-based GenAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT mobile app) and achieve an 80% or higher suitability score through peer and instructor validation.",
    "Learners identify three core elements (data collection methods, real-time analysis algorithms, personalized feedback generation logic) to consider when designing GenAI-based formative assessment feedback systems. Within one week, they develop a prototype instructional design and present a validation plan (e.g., comparative learning outcome experiments)."
