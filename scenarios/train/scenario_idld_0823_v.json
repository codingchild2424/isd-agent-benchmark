    "Learners can use EdTech tools in a flipped learning environment to record ≥2 weekly self-practice sessions for pronunciation/intonation and improve expressive skills and fluency based on voice analysis reports.",
    "Learners can achieve ≥80% accuracy in breath control and articulation via a smart voice monitoring system and produce natural language expressions using advanced vocabulary and complex sentence structures.",
    "Learners can collaborate with ≤3 teammates to record/produce a 3-minute original song, present it in ≤5 minutes (video or live), and score ≥4/5 in ≥4 of 5 peer rubric items (pronunciation, fluency, intonation, creativity, collaboration)."
