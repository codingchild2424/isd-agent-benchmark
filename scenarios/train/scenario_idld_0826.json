  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic organizational procedures and safety management concepts, foundational statistics (mean, standard deviation, hypothesis testing), mathematical modeling (equations, graphs), and probability concepts (probability distributions, simulations)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "A training course for practitioners on safety procedures within enterprises, focusing on systematically applying knowledge acquired in real work environments through mathematical analysis (graph visualization, probability models, statistical tests). Special emphasis is placed on enhancing data-driven decision-making abilities, including analysis practice using tools like R/Python.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Organizational culture awareness indicators can be modeled as mathematical variables (continuous/categorical), and regression analysis can explain their impact on knowledge acquisition (AOK).",
    "Self-efficacy enhancement strategies can be modeled using probability distributions (normal/beta distribution), and Monte Carlo simulations can propose methods to improve new knowledge application capabilities.",
    "Learners select three case studies of safety and security procedures applied in corporate environments and present a 5-minute analysis of results from descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, variance) and inferential statistics (t-test, ANOVA, chi-square test).",
    "Learners derive three learning motivation strategies using linear/nonlinear equation models (polynomial regression, logistic regression) during a one-week corporate training program and analyze their impact on knowledge integration through five metrics (comprehension, application, satisfaction, creativity, efficiency)."
