  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Foundational science knowledge (experimental design, data measurement), limited experience in information retrieval, and basic understanding of the scientific inquiry process (observation–hypothesis–experiment–conclusion)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "An online course for practicing elementary school teachers conducted in smartphone-centric, technology-constrained environments. A blended learning model combining LMS-based asynchronous learning with embedded librarian education (subject-integrated support from librarians) is applied, with emphasis on utilizing scientific analysis tools (creating simple data visualization charts).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners select information sources based on ≥3 evaluation criteria (reliability, reproducibility, peer verification) that consider variable control and hypothesis testing in the scientific research process.",
    "Learners apply keyword optimization and database filtering techniques when searching for scientific papers using LMS-embedded tutorials and utilize APA-style reference formatting in practical tasks.",
    "Learners incorporate peer evaluations (2 times) and instructor feedback (1 time) to produce scientific reports meeting ≥80% compliance with each of three information literacy criteria (reliability, source citation, data accuracy) in project-based outputs."
