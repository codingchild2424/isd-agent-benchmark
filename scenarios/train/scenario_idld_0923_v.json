  "learning_goals": [
    "Using core e-learning platform functions (assignments, discussion boards, assessment tools), learners can effectively operate social studies educational content (historical event analysis, geographic data visualization, cultural diversity comparison) and derive evidence-based conclusions.",
    "In virtual learning environments, learners can design ≥three instructional strategies (problem-based learning, simulations, collaborative projects) that promote social studies inquiry skills (historical context understanding, geographic spatial analysis, cultural interaction awareness).",
    "Learners can plan and produce e-learning content tailored to social studies education (history-based documentaries, geography quiz mapping, cultural comparison collaborative activities) while incorporating elements for fostering citizenship.",
    "Learners will create an e-learning implementation roadmap (including learning objectives, content structure, technological tools, and assessment methods) applicable to actual social studies classes through project-based assessment over a 4-week course, and revise three or more core elements (e.g., historical evidence utilization, geographical data analysis, cultural context reflection) based on critical thinking and expert feedback."
