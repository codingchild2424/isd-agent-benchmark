    "After completing project deliverables (1 data visualization report, 1 computational model) by the 3rd month of a 6-month course, learners submit self-assessments with ≥70% achievement across 5 evaluation criteria (accuracy, creativity, collaboration, practicality, completeness) and integrate peer feedback (average ≥4.0 on a 5-point scale from 3 peers per criterion) into the final evaluation report.",
    "By comparing traditional corporate assessments (exam scores, assignment results) with multimodal digital assessment data (video analysis, quiz metrics, engagement indicators), learners conduct quantitative analyses ensuring ≥90% data consistency for 3 learning effectiveness metrics (knowledge acquisition rate, skill application, engagement change) and write a 5-page comparative report meeting ≥4 of 5 rubric criteria in APA style."
