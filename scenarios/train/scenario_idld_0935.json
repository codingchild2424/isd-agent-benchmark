  "title": "Design and Implementation of Digital-Based Historical Text Analysis and Language Expression Curriculum",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic historical knowledge, fundamental digital tool proficiency, historical text comprehension and basic grammar understanding, recognition of history-related vocabulary and era-specific expressions",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Develop and evaluate digital history education modules applicable across diverse technological infrastructures. Focus on improving learners' text analysis skills (lexical extraction, contextual analysis) and historical expression (narrative reconstruction, argumentative writing). Incorporate linguistic approaches (discourse analysis, lexical studies) into instructional design.",
    "institution_type": "Vocational training institution",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can analyze contextual meanings and vocabulary usage (historical terms, idioms, era-specific expressions) in three provided historical texts using two VR tools, one interactive timeline, and one online archive, submitting structured reports (word frequency tables, contextual explanations, historical background connections).",
    "Learners can enhance critical expression skills (persuasive writing, logical structuring) through argumentative discussions and historical narrative reconstruction projects with peers on a digital collaboration platform.",
    "Learners achieve 80%+ proficiency in linguistic understanding of historical concepts (text interpretation, term application, contextual inference) via a digital assessment system."
