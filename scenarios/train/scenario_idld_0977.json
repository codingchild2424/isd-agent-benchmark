    "Learners understand XML-based tagging systems and can modularly organize language content for VR scenarios.",
    "Learners can perform team project-based assessments (3-person teams) in a BYOD environment, design two or more communication strategies applicable to three real-world language use scenarios (e.g., business meetings, customer service), and achieve an average score of 3.5 or higher on a 5-point scale in peer and instructor evaluations, with supporting documentation."
