  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic math assessment design and elementary curriculum understanding, mastery of fundamental concepts in functions, equations, and statistics, experience with assessment tools (e.g., Google Forms), and foundational knowledge of statistical analysis (mean, variance calculation)",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Utilize smartphone-based assessment tools: implement automated multiple-choice grading via Google Forms and chatbot feedback for function/statistical graph interpretation. In offline classes, conduct problem-solving strategy workshops (equation-solving algorithms, graph interpretation techniques) integrated with digital assessments. Assessment results are used for descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation) and inferential statistics (t-tests) to analyze learning achievement.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Developing formative assessment design skills using online evaluation tools in a blended learning model: creating assessment items for polynomial equations and exponential function problem-solving and conducting item reliability analysis.",
    "By the end of the mid-term course (4 weeks), learners can build a smartphone-based real-time feedback system in three stages (design–implementation–testing), achieve over 80% satisfaction from 10 peer learners, and write an operational manual. The system must include automated scoring for multiple-choice questions, function graph interpretation feedback for open-ended responses, and statistical significance testing for results.",
    "Within the mid-term course (2–4 weeks), learners can develop weekly online assessments aligned with vocational training institutions’ mathematics curriculum, consisting of three open-ended questions (including proof problems: e.g., mathematical induction) and five multiple-choice questions (including probability and statistics problems: e.g., normal distribution, standard deviation calculations). The assessments must meet validity criteria (content validity ≥80%, Cronbach’s α ≥0.7) and item appropriateness (three difficulty levels, discrimination index ≥0.3)."
