    "Learners can connect HTML tags and web page output results with 80% accuracy using visual models (diagrams/arrows) and understand information representation structures and civic engagement methods in digital society.",
    "Learners can complete provided HTML assignments (e.g., basic page composition) in a simulation environment within 3 attempts, achieving ≥70% accuracy in error correction, thereby cultivating digital problem-solving skills and technical adaptability.",
    "Learners can independently produce a 2-page static web page (including headers, body text, and images) through project-based assessment, demonstrating creative expression skills as digital citizens and cultural communication competencies."
