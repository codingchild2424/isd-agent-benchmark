Collaboration with tools in a BYOD environment is recommended, with emphasis on sharing experimental data and evidence-based analysis activities. Learners systematically record observational data and repeatedly train in deriving scientific conclusions based on this data.",

    "Using metadata provided by the learning design framework, learners will design one science-subject-customized curriculum (including experimental design, variable control, data analysis, and evidence-based conclusion derivation).",
    "Learners will develop three or more learning objects (virtual lab modules, observation templates, scientific analysis worksheets) that integrate theoretical knowledge (literature review) with practical cases (best practices).",
    "Through peer evaluation processes (feedback forms and discussion sessions), learners will write a report validating the reusability (three or more scenarios: cross-subject integration, tiered application by proficiency, hybrid online/offline delivery) and scalability (two or more expansion methods: AR experiment tool integration, multi-variable analysis functionality) of their designed science curriculum. The report must receive a rating of \"Met\" or higher from at least two out of three evaluators."
