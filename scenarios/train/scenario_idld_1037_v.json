  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Theoretical knowledge of elementary mathematics education (geometry, measurement, algebra domains) and experience in designing lessons based on Bloom’s taxonomy. Possession of basic skills in using web-based tools and the ability to perform fundamental formula calculations and interpret graphs",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Requires optimization for low-technology environments to utilize smartphone-based IWE tools. Aims to enhance instructional design competencies for math concepts (formulas, graphs, statistics) aligned with Bloom's taxonomy levels. Needs to provide differentiated problem-solving activities (calculation, measurement, proof) by learner level. Strengthens evidence-based analysis through virtual manipulation tools.",

    "Using IWE-based 3D geometric models and virtual manipulation tools, learners can improve spatial perception and geometric problem-solving abilities (formula application, measurement, proof) by 20%.",
    "Design three IWE activities per math domain (equation solving, graph interpretation, statistical analysis) aligned with Bloom’s Taxonomy levels of \"Understanding-Applying-Analyzing.\"",
    "Select two low-spec IWE tools accessible via smartphone web browsers, establish a lesson integration plan, and incorporate them into calculation, measurement, and proof activities."
