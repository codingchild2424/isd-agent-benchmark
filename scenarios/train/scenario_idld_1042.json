    "Design web-based experiential learning modules that consider the cognitive styles of students with special educational needs",
    "Learners can analyze three provided scientific experiment datasets (e.g., temperature-time changes, pH-concentration relationships, reaction rate measurements) using Python-based data analysis tools (Pandas, Matplotlib) and generate two or more visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, line graphs) per dataset. Additionally, they can write a learner-specific comprehension diagnostic report (3 pages) based on the visualizations and provide customized feedback meeting at least four of five checklist criteria: data accuracy, visualization appropriateness, analytical logic, report structure, and feedback specificity.",
    "Learners can apply visual support (graphic explanations, color contrast adjustments) and auditory support (subtitles, audio descriptions) strategies to science-integrated experiential activities (experiments, observations, simulations) and create an accessibility improvement report achieving over 80% satisfaction from three or more students with disabilities.",
    "Within a 3-week project period, learners can perform three functional tests (maximum load measurement, repetitive motion accuracy, energy efficiency analysis) on a robotic arm prototype, incorporate five or more peer/instructor feedbacks, and write a 5-page report specifying two improvement strategies."
