  "learning_goals": [
    "Non-math-major teachers systematically reorganize secondary mathematics curriculum content (equations, functions, geometry) and explain the interconnectedness of mathematical concepts and formulas through logical proofs and graph analysis.",
    "In a blended learning environment, the learner collaborates with two peer teachers to complete one problem-solving-centered mathematics teaching design plan, develops one activity sheet (measurement/statistics/geometry) tailored to three learning types (visual/auditory/kinesthetic) and one digital tool (GeoGebra, etc.), and implements it to meet at least four out of five peer evaluation rubric criteria.",
    "Over six months, the learner collaborates in a team of 3–5 members to develop mathematics educational materials for 3rd–4th graders (five activity sheets: measurement/statistics/geometry, one digital tool: virtual manipulatives), achieves an 80%+ suitability score in peer and expert reviews, and completes the project."
