  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can revise the clarity of language research questions and the scientific validity of data collection plans two or more times through peer evaluation.",
    "Learners can improve the logical consistency and evidence-based validity of research conclusions by over 30% according to peer feedback and systematically integrate text analysis results.",
    "Learners can complete over 80% of the language inquiry process (hypothesis setting → observation → analysis → conclusion) through structured academic dialogues with peers in VR-based collaborative environments.",
    "Learners can demonstrate a collaborative attitude by fairly recognizing peer evaluation processes and accepting feedback, correcting over 50% of expression and grammatical errors in research papers."
