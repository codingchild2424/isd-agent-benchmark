  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic instructional design principles, LMS usage experience, and foundational knowledge of elementary language education (reading, writing, speaking, listening). Particularly, experience in grammatical structure analysis and text-based expression evaluation",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Aims to enhance e-learning feedback design capabilities for pre-service/elementary school teachers in language education. Focuses on implementing vocabulary, grammar, and writing feedback using asynchronous LMS in environments with provided digital devices (laptops/tablets). Centers on developing personalized feedback strategies to improve reading comprehension and expressive skills.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "By analyzing learner behavioral data (vocabulary acquisition, grammar comprehension, text interpretation skills, etc.), three types of language learning feedback personas can be identified: Basic Vocabulary Reinforcement, Grammar Structure Exploration, and Integrated Text Interpretation.",
    "Clustering techniques can classify language learning characteristics (e.g., reading speed, writing patterns, lexical diversity) and design personalized language feedback strategies (grammar error diagnosis, expression diversification suggestions, text restructuring support).",
    "In actual language e-learning environments, time-based sampling data (e.g., quiz response time, text interaction frequency) can predict learner personas (Basic/Intermediate/Advanced) with over 65% accuracy.",
    "Through project-based assessment, learners propose at least three real-time language feedback loop designs using conversational agents (e.g., ChatGPT, Grammarly) and create prototype implementation documents meeting criteria: grammar error correction accuracy over 85% and at least five expression diversification suggestions per proposal."
