  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Advanced-level specialized knowledge (medical terminology, clinical protocols, etc.) and extensive practical experience, basic ability to compose and interpret medical documents, and understanding of specialized vocabulary and grammatical structures",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Cultivating practical communication skills in medical contexts through language simulation in smartphone-centric environments. Emphasizes language use close to real clinical settings via **integrated speaking/listening in virtual patient consultations**, **text structuring/lexical selection in electronic medical records**, and **role-specific expressions/technical terminology in multidisciplinary team scenarios**. Includes evaluations of grammatical accuracy, lexical appropriateness, and communicative effectiveness",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "In patient-healthcare role-playing based on medical scenarios, learners perform with ≥80% accuracy using **specialized terminology** (medical terms, abbreviations) and communication strategies.",
    "Learners achieve ≥70% accuracy in using specialized terms contextually when documenting and interpreting medical records, cultivating structured text organization skills.",
    "In emergency simulations, learners apply ≥3 appropriate language strategies (e.g., patient status explanation, instruction delivery, collaboration requests) and utilize situational expression strategies (clarity, conciseness, empathetic language).",
    "In team-based virtual clinical simulations, learners apply the **SBAR communication protocol** to develop communication plans for three clinical scenarios (emergency, chronic care, interdisciplinary consultation), achieving ≥4/5 average in peer reviews (2+ out of 3 peers) and simulation rubrics. This includes applying a 3-step structure (subjective-objective-request) in patient reporting, using ≥5 specialized terms in treatment planning, and clearly expressing role divisions (responsibilities, task sequences) in interdisciplinary collaboration."
