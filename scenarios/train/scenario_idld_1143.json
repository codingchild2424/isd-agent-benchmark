  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can recreate the legal and social context of historical events (e.g., the Méndez v. Westminster case) through VR simulations and mathematically analyze related statistical data.",
    "From an anti-essentialist perspective, learners can categorize changes in racial policies into four stages (simple claims → recognition of complexity → relationship analysis → multidimensional interpretation) and describe them in project reports.",
    "Learners can extract historical evidence (e.g., court records, demographic statistics) proving the incompleteness of racial progress narratives from VR tools and create comparative tables."
