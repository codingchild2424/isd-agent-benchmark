    "Learners design a 2-factor survey instrument (5 motivational items: goal-setting, interest maintenance; 5 strategic items: time management, resource utilization) to measure self-regulated learning in online environments. They conduct expert validity evaluation (CVI ≥0.8) and internal consistency verification (Cronbach's α ≥0.7)",
    "Learners perform CFA on survey data (≥10 items) using AMOS or R (lavaan), producing reports with construct validity results meeting GFI >0.9 and CFI >0.9, metric invariance confirmed via multi-group analysis, and reliability analysis results with Cronbach's α >0.7",
    "At the six-month course conclusion, learners design fairness evaluation metrics considering ≥3 demographic variables (gender, age group, network access: 5G/Wi-Fi/4G). They propose methods to reduce model performance deviations within 10% using fairness verification tools (e.g., Fairlearn)"
