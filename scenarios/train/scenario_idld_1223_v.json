  "title": "Language Education Design and Learning Environment Optimization for Responsive Blended Learning: Strengthening Text Analysis, Writing, and Expression Skills",
  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic language proficiency (reading, writing, grammar comprehension) and experience using online learning tools, foundational vocabulary skills for text analysis, and understanding of writing feedback mechanisms",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Current professionals balancing work and study, primarily accessing learning via smartphones. Due to geographical and economic constraints, there is a high need for flexible schedules and customized language support. Key goals include improving business document writing and communication skills, with emphasis on text structure analysis, specialized vocabulary acquisition, and persuasive expression development.",
    "institution_type": "Public/Non-profit educational institution",
    "learner_age": "In their 30s",
    "learner_education": "Adult learner (non-degree)",
    "learner_role": "Student",
    "domain_expertise": "Intermediate"
  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will explain the core elements of a responsive blended learning model (customized vocabulary support, flexible grammar learning, step-by-step text task design) using scientific inquiry methods.",
    "Learners will use LMS and smartphone-based tools to create a self-directed reading-writing learning plan at least three times per week and evaluate execution results with evidence-based analysis (e.g., reading speed measurement).",
    "Learners will improve writing assignments through peer feedback-based processes using online collaboration tools and derive revision strategies considering grammatical accuracy and expressive diversity.",
    "Every two weeks, learners will analyze interim assessment results (diagnostic reports) to derive at least three language learning strategy adjustments (e.g., improving reading speed, reducing grammar errors, expanding expressive range). They will record these in a metacognitive journal (including checklists) and systematically monitor their learning progress."
