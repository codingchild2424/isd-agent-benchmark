  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Completion of advanced courses and extensive practical experience in specialized fields: familiarity with dental hygiene terminology, experience developing patient education materials, foundational skills in academic writing and digital content creation. Additionally, basic patient communication skills (listening, speaking, reading, writing) and understanding of grammatical structures",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Practical training program for aspiring dental hygienists, aiming to strengthen digital educational material development capabilities. Focuses on professional-to-general language conversion (vocabulary/sentence-level), visual text composition (graphs, infographics), and patient-tailored communication strategies. Holistically improves learners' reading comprehension (medical text understanding) and expression (educational material creation)",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Develop e-book chapters aligned with Fink’s Six Taxonomies of Significant Learning (Foundational Knowledge, Application, Integration, Human Dimension, Learning How to Learn, Caring): Ensure accuracy of dental hygiene terminology and enhance logical structuring of patient education texts",
    "Learners analyze 3 real dental clinical cases within a week, develop 1 patient education resource (oral care video or pamphlet), and produce materials demonstrating ability to translate jargon into lay language and use visual effectiveness (graphic organizers). Achieve ≥4/5 points in peer/instructor rubrics (content accuracy, practicality, visual effectiveness)",
    "Learners create a professional communication improvement plan based on 3 peer feedbacks and 2 reflective journal entries, propose ≥2 actionable strategies per feedback analysis table (clarity, logic, appropriateness), including patient-tailored verbal/nonverbal communication strategies"
