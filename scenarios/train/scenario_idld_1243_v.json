    "Learners systematically understand and explain theological concepts and social values (e.g., civil rights, community relationships, cultural diversity) through online learning materials and asynchronous discussions",
    "Over six months, learners participate in biweekly online community discussions within companies (topic: linking theological values with social practices), achieving discussion engagement criteria (90%+ attendance rate, ≥5 contributions/session). They also submit monthly self-reflection journals (≥500 characters, meeting ≥4 of 5 rubric criteria) reflecting theological values (justice, love, forgiveness) and social practices, achieving ≥80% fulfillment in peer evaluations (average ≥4 on 5-point scale) and instructor feedback (≥4 points)",
    "Learners analyze three real-world community cases (e.g., multicultural family conflicts, local elderly welfare issues, political minority rights promotion) over six months, applying pastoral skills (counseling, mediation, networking) and understanding of social systems to develop action plans. They achieve ≥4 points (out of 5) on institutional rubrics (problem definition clarity, contextual relevance, feasibility, cultural sensitivity) to propose field-applicable solutions"
