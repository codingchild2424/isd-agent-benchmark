  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic scientific knowledge (experimental design, data analysis, variable control), professional practice experience, understanding of the scientific inquiry process (hypothesis formation→experimentation→observation→conclusion), and foundational statistical skills (calculating mean, standard deviation)",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online synchronous (Zoom, etc.)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Optimized participation via smartphones, emphasizing collaboration among experts and focusing on scientific evidence collection and shared experimental observation data. Particular attention is given to securing experimental reproducibility through variable control, improving measurement accuracy, and evaluating the ability to derive evidence-based conclusions.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can use the five competency dimensions of the ATHENA model (analysis, technology, collaboration, creativity, responsibility) to address microplastic reduction-related science problems by: (1) establishing at least three hypotheses, (2) writing a research plan specifying controlled conditions for independent/dependent variables in experimental design, and (3) producing an analysis report with descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation) and visualizations (bar graphs, scatter plots) using a virtual dataset. They achieve scientific validity of at least 80% through peer evaluation (based on three peers) and instructor feedback (meeting at least four out of five rubric criteria).",
    "In science-related practical tasks, learners can apply at least three of the 60 detailed competency elements (e.g., variable control, measurement accuracy, evidence-based conclusion drawing) to real-world cases and systematically record experimental observation data to produce reproducible results.",
    "Learners can exchange real-time feedback with three peers using Google Docs and Padlet, and within one week, create an improvement plan for a science lab report that includes: (1) a competency diagnosis result meeting at least three out of five rubric criteria, (2) three-stage action goals (e.g., improve data analysis, clarify conclusions, add references), and (3) critical thinking aligned with scientific inquiry procedures."
