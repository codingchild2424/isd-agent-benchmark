    "Learners will improve oral and written communication skills (pronunciation, intonation, sentence structure) by collaboratively solving tasks in mobile environments according to given scenarios",
    "Learners will analyze real-life language issues (grammar error patterns, lexical context usage, pragmatic appropriateness) using digital tools (speech analyzers, vocabulary mapping tools) and propose constructivist solutions",
    "Over 1–6 months, learners will correct over 80% of pronunciation, grammar, and expression errors using a weekly formative feedback system (automated grammar checks, pronunciation accuracy analysis) and achieve over 90 points (out of 100) in three consecutive monthly evaluations (integrated language proficiency tests) to improve language accuracy"
