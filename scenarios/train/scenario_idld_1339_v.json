  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Completion of advanced coursework and extensive professional field experience. Foundational understanding of scientific inquiry methods (experiment design, data analysis, conclusion drawing) required. Prior experience with variable control, observational recording, and evidence-based reasoning recommended",

    "additional_context": "Asynchronous collaborative learning in a smartphone-based LMS, applying constructivist approaches to deepen understanding through peer knowledge sharing. Emphasizes experimental data and evidence-based analysis to develop scientific thinking. Systematically practices observation recording, data measurement, analytical techniques, and conclusion-drawing, with a focus on enhancing scientific argumentation through peer feedback.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Using digital collaboration tools (e.g., Google Docs, Padlet), learners complete three inquiry notes on science concepts, generate two comparison tables, produce one explanatory video, and formulate two hypotheses based on experimental observation data. They clearly distinguish independent/dependent variables and write a scientific experiment design document, achieving over 80% of the evaluation criteria within the process period.",
    "Learners can revise their reasoning process at least twice using externalized knowledge (e.g., experimental data, case studies) during peer feedback sessions (3+ times) and write a scientific report that meets at least two of the three critical thinking checklist criteria (validity, sufficiency of evidence, consideration of alternatives). The report must include experimental result analysis and evidence-based conclusions.",
    "Learners participate in 3+ asynchronous text-based collaborative platform (Slack, Google Docs, etc.) discussions on scientific topics (e.g., climate change, energy transition), draft an integrated report (1,000+ characters) incorporating peer feedback, and meet an 80%+ completeness standard for assessment submission. The report must include measurable evidence, data analysis results, and scientific conclusions."
