  "learning_goals": [
    "Over a six-month long-term course, learners complete three structured algorithm documents by decomposing complex problems arising from three real-world enterprise projects into five steps or fewer, expressing them via pseudocode or flowcharts. Each document achieves over 80% completeness through peer review and expert validation, adhering to clear syntactic structures and professional terminology in code comments",
    "Based on pre-post problem-solving competency model analysis, learners establish personalized learning strategies and enhance code commenting/documentation skills. To improve technical document literacy and expression accuracy, they utilize a professional terminology glossary and template guide",
    "Through GBDT-based competency assessment, learners improve programming problem-solving efficiency by over 30% and acquire error message interpretation and debugging expression skills. They cultivate the ability to systematically describe problem causes and clearly express solutions in error analysis reports"
