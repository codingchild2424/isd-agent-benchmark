    "Learners can design two collaborative learning scenarios reflecting social constraints (time/space/role distribution) during the third month of a six-month course and achieve over 80% suitability scores in peer reviews and instructor feedback.",
    "Learners can develop three or more core metrics (e.g., 15% improvement in learning efficiency, 80% reuse rate, learner satisfaction ≥4.0/5.0) to evaluate the effectiveness of reusable instructional design models, apply them to actual training programs, and report data-based achievement within three months."
