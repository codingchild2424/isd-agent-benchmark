    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Problem-based education emphasizing collaboration and real-time feedback in smartphone-based learning environments. Learners apply the actual scientific inquiry process (problem definition → hypothesis formulation → experiment execution → result analysis) to coding tasks, exchanging evidence-based feedback (execution results, test data, code quality metrics) through peer evaluation.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can solve complex coding tasks by applying three or more scientific problem-solving strategies (hypothesis setting, variable control, experimental design).",
    "Learners perform driver/navigator roles at least once each in three or more pair programming sessions within a week and submit a code review report meeting four or more of five collaboration checklist items (code readability, comment quality, test coverage, feature completeness, version control) to achieve over 80% evaluation criteria.",
    "Learners improve debugging and logical error correction skills through five or more formative assessments, collect and analyze measurable evidence data (execution logs, test results, performance metrics), and present improvement outcomes."
