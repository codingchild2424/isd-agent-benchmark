  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Intermediate-level knowledge in science (experimental design, data analysis, scientific inquiry methods, variable control techniques) and practical teaching experience; requires the ability to collect and interpret scientific evidence",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "For mid-level science pre-service teachers from medical/legal/technical professions. Mobile device-based learning optimized for PC-unavailable environments. Emphasis on evidence-based approaches and measurable learning outcomes in science content delivery. All lesson designs must include scientific analysis procedures and conclusion-drawing processes.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can design 15-minute mobile-friendly instructional materials incorporating TPACK components (technology-pedagogy-content knowledge) that include science experiment design, systematic observation, hypothesis verification, and variable control processes",
    "Learners can analyze the characteristics of adult learners over 40 (basic science knowledge level, digital literacy) and design/implement a 5-minute microlearning prototype incorporating three or more interactive elements (quizzes, simulations, discussion forums). The content must reflect the scientific inquiry process and evidence-based approaches",
    "Through self- and peer assessment based on TPACK evaluation rubrics, learners can derive improvements for science lesson design and present strategies for controlling variables in experiments following scientific analysis procedures."
