    "Learners can explain core calculus concepts (limits, continuity, rates of change) by manipulating 3D graphs in a VR environment.",
    "Learners can document the math problem-solving process collaboratively with team members using multimodal representations (visual modeling, audio explanations, text annotations).",
    "Learners can analyze data collected from VR simulations, represent real-world phenomena (e.g., fluid dynamics) as mathematical models, and present their findings."
