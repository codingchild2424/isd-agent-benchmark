  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Basic digital literacy, language learning experience (foundational grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, and discourse analysis), participation in online discussions, and text-based communication experience in asynchronous environments",
    "duration": "Mid-term course (2-4 weeks)",
    "learning_environment": "Simulation/VR-based",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "VR simulation-based course using personal devices, aiming for context-based language acquisition and application. Focuses on improving expressive abilities, discourse construction, and pragmatic analysis. Emphasizes asynchronous interaction for deep language processing (text analysis, critical thinking, structured feedback). Particularly targets practical language proficiency through communication strategy development and discourse coherence evaluation.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners apply language use strategies (lexical, grammatical, pragmatic elements) in real-life contexts via VR simulations with over 80% accuracy, analyze discourse structures by context, and effectively utilize communication strategies.",
    "Learners generate at least two meaningful cognitive questions (analytical/critical) per week in asynchronous discussions, provide structured feedback on peers' texts considering grammatical, lexical, and pragmatic elements, and develop the ability to evaluate discourse coherence.",
    "Learners select two of three language use cases introduced in guest lectures, write analytical reports (structure: introduction-analysis-conclusion, 450–550 characters) for each, apply two core language concepts (communication strategies, discourse analysis, pragmatic approaches, etc.) acquired from the lectures, and submit project outcomes within one week after the 4-week course."
