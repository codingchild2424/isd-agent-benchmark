    "The learner selects one local community issue (e.g., waste segregation, lack of park facilities), analyzes at least three causes using citizen science project data (e.g., environmental monitoring data, survey results), and writes a project proposal (3–5 pages) including at least two solutions.",
    "The learner chooses one SDG (Sustainable Development Goal), designs a linked STEM solution (e.g., solar energy devices, recycling robots), produces a 5–10 minute presentation, and achieves at least 3 out of 4 points in peer and teacher evaluation rubrics (clarity of topic, creativity, feasibility, expression).",
    "Using online collaboration tools like Google Jamboard and Padlet, the learner works with a multidisciplinary team of 3–5 members (mixing science/art/technology fields) to derive at least three actionable solutions for solving a local community issue (e.g., improving waste segregation), creates team presentation materials, and presents them at a class-sharing session."
