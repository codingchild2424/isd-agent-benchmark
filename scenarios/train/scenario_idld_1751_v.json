Focuses on theory-practice integration (linguistics + corporate applications) and interdisciplinary collaboration (linguistics + business administration + education). Aims to enhance learners' advanced reading/writing skills and intercultural communication competencies, cultivating language analysis and educational design abilities in real corporate settings.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners analyze pragmatic/discourse characteristics and lexical usage patterns of language text/voice data with ≥80% accuracy using online collaboration tools (e.g., Padlet, Miro)",
    "Learners improve language education design competencies (e.g., curriculum development, assessment tool creation, instructional strategy design) by ≥40% through peer evaluation and feedback systems (rubric-based)",
    "Learners develop ≥3 portfolios applying language acquisition theories (e.g., input hypothesis, output hypothesis, interaction hypothesis) to real-world corporate cases (e.g., global team communication, localization strategies, intercultural communication) in blended environments (online workshops + field practice). Each portfolio achieves ≥80% fulfillment via peer review (≥3 peers, peer review criteria) and expert review (1 session, language education expert criteria). Portfolios must include text analysis, writing samples, and intercultural communication strategies"
