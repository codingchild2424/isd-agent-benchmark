    "Learners can conduct a comparative study of experimental and control groups applying three UDL strategies (multimedia materials, flexible assessment methods, structured collaborative learning) over a three-week project-based assessment. They collect data on learning engagement (attendance rate ≥80%, discussion participation ≥5 times) and achievement (exam scores improved by 10%, assignment scores ≥B+) from 20 students with disabilities, and write a 10-page analysis report verifying statistical significance (p-value <0.05) using SPSS."
