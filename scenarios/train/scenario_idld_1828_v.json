    "prior_knowledge": "Advanced learning completion and high-level project experience, business English/Korean writing proficiency (grammar/vocabulary accuracy and mastery of formal expressions), basic digital literacy, foundational communication experience in multicultural settings",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",

    "additional_context": "Customized training for current practitioners focusing on acquiring CMC (Computer-Mediated Communication) skills immediately applicable to work settings. It emphasizes effective language expression in global contexts (distinguishing formal/informal expressions, considering cultural contexts, and utilizing idiomatic expressions) and integrated use of digital collaboration tools. Rubric-based feedback evaluates improvements in reading comprehension, expression, and non-verbal communication integration.",

    "Learners can explain the operational principles of various CMC tools (asynchronous forums, real-time collaboration platforms) and language strategies (formal/informal expression distinctions, vocabulary selection), while comparing and analyzing text-based communication with multimodal expression methods (integrating non-verbal elements).",
    "In public/nonprofit scenarios (e.g., proposal writing, video briefings, online budget negotiations), learners can design three+ effective CMC strategies for each task—document writing (grammar/vocabulary accuracy, contextual appropriateness), video conferencing (non-verbal expression integration, cultural context reflection), and online negotiation (persuasive language strategies, evidence-based arguments)—and achieve ≥80% performance in simulated work evaluations.",
    "Using CMC technologies (Slack, Zoom, Google Workspace), learners can complete a 6-month digital collaboration project resolving three real-world tasks (e.g., global team scheduling, document co-editing, video conference facilitation), meeting ≥80% in evaluation criteria (teamwork 30%, technical application 40%, problem-solving efficacy 30%). Additionally, they must fulfill ≥4 out of 5 rubric items assessing cross-cultural communication skills (cultural context consideration, non-verbal communication, idiomatic expression understanding)."
