    "Learners can propose three or more application plans for social issues in real-world professional contexts (medical/legal/technical) using interactive multimedia activities (timeline charts, virtual case simulations) within an LMS",
    "Learners self-diagnose multimedia learning effectiveness and develop improvement plans through formative assessment quizzes (image-text matching, video analysis)."
