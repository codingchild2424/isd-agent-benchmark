    "Learners form teams of three in 2-week participatory learning activities to analyze three nonlinear problems based on real-world work cases (e.g., project delays, budget overruns) and derive solutions through collaborative experimentation (e.g., brainstorming, simulations), achieving 4+ points (on a 5-point scale) in at least two of three evaluation rubric criteria (creativity, feasibility, collaboration efficiency)."
