    "Learners will explain database design principles (normalization, ERD creation) for social science data management through 10-minute microlearning modules.",
    "Learners will apply SQL query writing and execution in a VR-based simulation to real-world social science scenarios (demographics, cultural resources).",
    "Learners will design and implement a small-scale social science research support application (CRUD functionality) with ≥3 tables using SQL basics and database design knowledge acquired from microlearning over a 2-week project. The final output must pass a functionality test (≥80% success) and peer evaluation (≥4/5)."
