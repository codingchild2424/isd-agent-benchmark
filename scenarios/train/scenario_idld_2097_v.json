    "Over six months, learners solve problems in three project-based assignments (4–5 members per team) by applying cognitive learning strategies (metacognition, concept mapping, case comparison analysis) and ensure final outputs (reports/presentations) achieve ≥3 points per category (≥9/12 total) on a rubric (problem definition clarity, strategy appropriateness, action plan specificity, outcome effectiveness).",
    "Learners improve their final GPA by ≥0.3 points over six months by setting weekly study plans (using time management matrices), course-specific GPA goals, writing weekly learning journals, and incorporating advisor feedback."
