    "Developing an action plan to reduce carbon emissions by over 30% when operating education using digital tools",
    "Learners will design a carbon neutrality education model within 6 months, utilizing an online platform (e.g., LMS) and offline workshops (quarterly, once per quarter), incorporating three core modules: carbon emission calculation, renewable energy application strategies, and carbon offset project design. They will submit a prototype report meeting internal evaluation criteria (module completeness ≥80%, feasibility ≥70%).",
    "Diagnosing the current state of carbon emissions in corporate education and proposing improvement strategies",
    "Learners will identify three organizational/cultural barriers (e.g., resistance culture, technical deficiencies, misaligned workflows) that may arise during digital education transitions. They will propose at least two actionable solutions (e.g., tool utilization plans, communication protocols) per barrier and ensure validity through peer review, achieving an average score of ≥4 on a 5-point scale."
