    "Learners enhance peer evaluation and feedback skills using collaborative tools (discussion boards, co-editing documents) in mobile environments, particularly strengthening professional vocabulary usage and grammatical accuracy in business contexts.",
    "In project-based assessments reflecting real-world job scenarios (e.g., business negotiations, report writing), learners submit results meeting over 80% of evaluation criteria (rubric) by utilizing three or more language skills (listening, speaking, writing, reading).",
    "Learners design three communication strategies (e.g., active listening, clear expression, cultural sensitivity) for building instructor-learner trust in virtual environments (Zoom, Microsoft Teams, etc.), implement them at least twice weekly for four weeks, and achieve an average satisfaction score of 4 or higher on a 5-point participant feedback survey."
