    "prior_knowledge": "Possession of intermediate-level knowledge and practical experience in the field (understanding of basic grammar/vocabulary, text analysis skills, experience in evaluating simple writing/reading tasks)",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Most learners are non-specialists but civically engaged individuals deeply interested in language education. Project-based assessments to strengthen practical competencies (module design, assessment tool development, gamification strategy formulation). Special focus on educational material development targeting adult learners' reading comprehension and expressive skills.",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners will apply principles of precision teaching (clear goal-setting, systematic feedback, repetitive practice) to draft at least five integrated online language-learning modules (reading, writing, listening), achieving over 80% suitability in peer reviews and expert evaluations.",
    "Analysis and application of procedural knowledge (grammar rule application) and declarative knowledge (vocabulary/expression acquisition) delivery effectiveness in online learning environments.",
    "Measurement of learning outcomes (writing completeness, pronunciation accuracy, etc.) and feedback system construction using project-based assessment tools.",
    "Learners will design at least three LMS (e.g., Moodle, Google Classroom) operational processes (course registration, progress monitoring, assessment management) and establish a quality-maintenance plan including at least five inspection items (accessibility, content update frequency, user feedback incorporation, grammar error verification, pronunciation model accuracy).",
    "Learners will design strategies incorporating at least three gamification elements (e.g., quizzes, badges, leaderboards) to enhance engagement of adult learners aged 40+ in digital educational material development (linked to vocabulary acquisition, sentence structuring, pronunciation practice), achieving over 80% suitability scores in peer reviews and expert evaluations."
