    "Learners can analyze language structures (character composition, sequence, direction) with over 80% accuracy using various visualization formats (dynamic/static-sequential/static).",
    "Learners can explain the impact of visualization format consistency (study-test congruence) between learning and assessment phases on learning outcomes.",
    "Learners can design language learning strategies using visual materials in project-based assessments and refine them through peer evaluation and instructor feedback."
