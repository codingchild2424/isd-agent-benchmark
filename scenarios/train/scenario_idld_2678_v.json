    "prior_knowledge": "Basic computer literacy, secondary-level science foundational knowledge (including experimental design and data analysis methods), and understanding of the scientific inquiry process",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Offline (classroom)",
    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learners use personal devices (BYOD) to design and apply computer-based educational tools integrated into science curricula, producing inquiry-centered deliverables applicable to real classrooms (experiment observation logs, data analysis templates) through project-based assessment.",

    "learner_age": "40s and above",
    "learner_education": "Middle school",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Designing a digital content production process for science curricula and implementing variable-controlled experiment simulations using XML-based open-source tools.",
    "Building an educational resource distribution system in a JAVA-based cross-platform environment and integrating scientific data visualization functionalities.",
    "Developing inquiry-based instructional materials that decouple content from delivery methods for flexible application across diverse educational contexts.",
    "Learners collaborate in teams of 3–4 to design two primary/secondary science education scenarios (including hypothesis setting, experimentation, analysis, and conclusion derivation), produce project-based assessment materials (with rubrics), and receive expert panel feedback averaging ≥4/5 on a 5-point scale."
