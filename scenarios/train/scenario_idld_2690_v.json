    "Learners can explain at least three e-learning material design principles (e.g., universal design for learning, cultural accessibility) considering diverse disability types and social contexts.",
    "Learners analyze social accessibility barriers (e.g., digital divide) using general instructional design tools (e.g., constructivist learning theory, collaborative learning design tools) and write a report.",
    "Learners prototype mobile-optimized accessible e-learning content (documents/videos) and validate its educational effectiveness and social inclusivity through peer evaluation."
