    "They can apply adult learning principles (learning environment design, motivation strategies) to real-world cases.",
    "Learners set three or more educational program objectives following the design phase of the ADDIE model (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation). They create a systematic mapping diagram linking detailed content, assessment methods, and activity plans for each objective. The diagram must achieve an \"Excellent\" rating in at least two of the three institutional rubric criteria (Clarity, Consistency, Feasibility).",
    "Learners conduct a 10-minute interactive lecture practice using question-promoting techniques (three open-ended and two confirmation questions) via Zoom/Teams platforms by Week 4 of a six-month course. They achieve a score of 4 or higher on a 5-point peer evaluation rubric (Engagement, Clarity, Interaction Frequency).",
    "Learners develop one rubric and one reflective journal template tailored for adult learners (30s) in public/nonprofit educational institutions. After applying them to an actual 1–6-month educational program, they demonstrate that over 80% of participants rate the assessment tools' usefulness at 4 or higher on a 5-point scale.",
    "Learners design three collaborative learning instructional strategies (e.g., peer review, group projects, role-play) for public/nonprofit educational contexts. After implementing them with ten learners over four weeks, they achieve an average satisfaction score of 4 or higher on a 5-point participation survey."
