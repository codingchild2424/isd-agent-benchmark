Activities must be feasible in smartphone-centric limited-technology environments.

    "Preservice teachers design a PBL (Project-Based Learning) model to teach five core health habits (e.g., handwashing, healthy eating) to young children, integrating mathematical calculations (e.g., measuring handwashing time) and graphing methods.",
    "Learners develop activities to verify the effectiveness of health behaviors by applying scientific inquiry methods (observation, experimentation, data analysis) and mathematical analysis (mean, ratio calculations).",
    "Based on Piaget’s cognitive development theory (preoperational, concrete operational stages), learners produce a 3–5-minute math learning video and a set of 10+ illustrated cards for young children, incorporating mathematical elements (number concepts 1–10, pattern recognition, basic shape classification) in mobile-optimized formats (MP4, PNG). The materials must meet at least four of five criteria (developmental appropriateness, interactivity, visual clarity, etc.) from peer and expert reviews."
