    "Over 1–6 months, learners will systematically record mathematical problem-solving processes (problem definition, solution steps, error analysis) in a digital portfolio (Google Sites or Notion) at least twice weekly. They will share feedback with three peer learners and meet at least four of the five final portfolio evaluation criteria."
