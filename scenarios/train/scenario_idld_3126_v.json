    "Within six months, learners can implement at least three statistical models (e.g., regression analysis, clustering analysis, time-series analysis) using Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy libraries) for bio-data (genomic/protein sequences), and complete a project meeting at least two model performance evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1-score, RMSE, etc.).",
    "Learners can create three types of IT project management documents (e.g., project plan, risk management documents) reflecting information security principles (confidentiality, integrity, availability), achieve scores of over 80% each in peer and instructor evaluation criteria (clarity, security requirement reflection, practicality), and produce 10-minute presentation materials to receive feedback rated \"average\" or higher from at least five audience members during the presentation."
