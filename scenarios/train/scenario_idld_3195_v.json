    "Learners can distinguish the three main types of metamorphism (contact, hydrothermal, dynamic) and explain the geological conditions of each process.",
    "Learners can create a conceptual map illustrating the relationship between the four types of plate tectonic movements (divergent/convergent/conservative/hotspot) and metamorphism.",
    "Learners achieve an 80% or higher accuracy rate on formative assessments covering 10 core concepts (e.g., isobars, geological map interpretation) provided through the QR code evaluation system."
