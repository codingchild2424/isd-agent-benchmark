    "Learners can explore new theoretical possibilities in language learning design by applying a dialogic interpretation framework.",
    "Learners can analyze formative assessment feedback (e.g., quiz results, learner surveys) and develop one AI education prototype reflecting instructional design theories (e.g., ADDIE model) within three weeks. They can perform a process where at least two out of three peer evaluators provide feedback indicating \"no need for improvement\" in two or fewer items."
