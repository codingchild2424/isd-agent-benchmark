    "Learners develop one 21st-century math lesson model using digital tools (GeoGebra, Desmos, etc.), create presentation materials scoring ≥12/15 on a peer-evaluation rubric (creativity, tech integration, educational effectiveness), and incorporate core math concepts (function graph modeling, statistical analysis, geometric proofs)."
