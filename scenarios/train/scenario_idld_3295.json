    "Learners can design self-directed learning modules by applying the PDSA (Plan-Do-Study-Act) model’s four stages.",
    "Learners can evaluate the effectiveness of developed modules using mixed research methods (quantitative + qualitative).",
    "Learners can create learning modules incorporating UDL (Universal Design for Learning), TPACK (Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge), and diversity inclusion principles."
