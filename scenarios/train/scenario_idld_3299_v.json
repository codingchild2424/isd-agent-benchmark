    "Participants explain the four components of the STEM ecosystem (research institutions, educational institutions, industries, government agencies) and the interaction principles among them. They submit at least two educational design plans linking classroom instruction with community field investigations (hospitals, science museums, etc.).",
    "Participants can identify ambiguity factors between in-class and out-of-class learning environments through interaction analysis and propose solutions",
    "Applying the four stages of design-based research (DBR) methodology (problem definition, prototype design, implementation, evaluation), participants develop one STEM education program prototype and present results showing at least 20% improvement in three core indicators (engagement, learning effectiveness, usability) through pre-post comparative evaluations."
