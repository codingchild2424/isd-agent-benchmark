    "Development of at least three interactive simulation materials for game-based problem-solving activities in online environments (including text-based scenarios, role-play dialogues, and strategic communication tasks)",
    "Learners can develop two rubrics for individual/team assessments suitable for vocational training language learning contexts within one week. Each rubric must include clear evaluation criteria and weighted scales (1-5 points) measuring student engagement (4 indicators: frequency of speech, diversity of questions, collaborative expressions, feedback utilization) and strategic thinking (3 indicators: tactical vocabulary use, logical explanation, creative problem-solving)"
