    "Learners can select one or more language-related problems in daily life (e.g., navigation, food ordering) using mobile devices (smartphones/tablets), create a three-stage project plan (problem definition, solution method, expected results), and execute a language project achieving at least 80% success rate in real situations. This enhances context-based communication skills and vocabulary application abilities.",
    "Learners can design a self-directed English vocabulary learning strategy applying creative thinking techniques (mind mapping, brainstorming) using two digital tools (Anki, Quizlet), implement it at least three times a week for two weeks, and evaluate learning effectiveness (20% improvement in vocabulary retention). This process strengthens grammar structure and text analysis skills.",
    "Learners can share language project outcomes through collaborative activities with peers (feedback sessions, peer reviews), improve final deliverables by reflecting on oral/written feedback, and develop critical thinking and expression skills."
