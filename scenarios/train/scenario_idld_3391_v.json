    "Learners can analyze the sociocultural impacts of ICT tools (techno-culture, cybercitizenship) in virtual environments through mathematical modeling.",
    "Learners can statistically analyze online interaction data (e.g., LMS logs, discussion forum activities) to generate at least three critical reflection questions (e.g., data reliability, bias, educational effectiveness), and write a 500-character report evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of ICT utilization strategies based on these questions.",
    "Learners can present a project deliverable proposing ICT integration strategies for building a sustainable learning ecosystem by applying mathematical problem-solving approaches."
