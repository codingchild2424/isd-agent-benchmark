    "Implement a Gradient Boosting model to predict colorectal cancer metastasis risk with over 75% accuracy.",
    "Based on feature importance analysis (e.g., visit frequency, treatment response rates, biomarker levels), learners can derive ≥3 clinical implications (e.g., correlation between visits and metastasis risk, specific biomarkers and recurrence rates) and document them in a structured 500-character report."
