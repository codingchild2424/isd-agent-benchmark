    "Through reflective journaling based on field practicum experiences, learners demonstrate a 20% or higher improvement in self-efficacy metrics and strengthen their awareness of roles as educators and citizens.",
    "Learners apply principles of complex adaptive systems (feedback loops, self-organization, etc.) to complete an inclusive lesson design project (selecting 1 topic from 5 options) in teams of 3–4, achieving over 80 points based on an evaluation rubric (creativity 25%, applicability 35%, completeness 40%). The project includes community resource integration and institutional support strategies."
