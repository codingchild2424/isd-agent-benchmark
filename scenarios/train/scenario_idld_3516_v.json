    "Learners can apply procedures for processing agricultural field data using deep learning-based image analysis tools while considering the social implications of spatial data interpretation.",
    "Learners can select one soil pollution case in a local agricultural setting using PBL (Problem-Based Learning), create a GIS-based soil sampling plan, conduct at least three field surveys, and produce an analysis report including five items (soil pH, heavy metal concentration, organic matter content, water retention, microbial diversity).",
    "Learners can explain the basic concepts of transformer model-based spatial analysis and propose ways to link them to regional development policies.",
    "Learners can visualize soil data using smartphone apps in limited technological environments and establish communication strategies to share results with local community stakeholders."
