  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners design sequential algorithms (≤3 steps, e.g., multiplication table output, maximum value identification) using basic programming syntax (variables, conditionals, loops) and implement them in Python/JavaScript to pass ≥80% of test cases, applying scientific inquiry methods (hypothesis → experiment → measurement → analysis) to evaluate code efficiency.",
    "Understanding and applying object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts (classes, inheritance, polymorphism) in mobile environments: designing classes and implementing polymorphism to process real scientific data (e.g., temperature readings, experimental results).",
    "Cultivating problem-solving skills through Java-based coding and debugging: case studies in scientific domains like medical data analysis or environmental monitoring simulations.",
    "Learners collaborate with 2–3 teammates for one week to complete a mini-project on GitHub/GitLab, demonstrating collaboration competencies via ≥5 code shares, ≥3 tracked/ resolved team collaboration issues. Project topics focus on scientific problems (e.g., weather data visualization, biodiversity analysis)."
