  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can apply three or more variations of body composition patterns (arm-leg coordination, weight distribution) at various angles (0°–90°) during indoor rock climbing.",
    "Learners expand their existing movement repertoires through an ecological dynamics approach and establish problem-solving strategies with over 80% success in new environments (virtual rock structures).",
    "Learners can analyze physical variables (friction, distance between support points) occurring during climbing through mathematical modeling (ratio/angle calculations) to derive optimal movement paths."
