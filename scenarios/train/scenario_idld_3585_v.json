Improves practical language skills (writing, presentation, proofreading) for employment preparation and strengthens adaptability to digital learning environments (online platforms, VR tools). Includes cultural sensitivity training for multicultural education settings",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners achieve an 80% or higher success rate in language tasks (reading, writing, listening) using various digital learning tools.",
    "Based on a digital literacy diagnostic survey (5 questions), learners design personalized feedback (3 types: grammar, vocabulary, expression enhancement) tailored to their proficiency level (beginner/intermediate/advanced). They provide feedback that receives a score of 3 or higher (on a 5-point scale) from two peer evaluators based on rubric criteria: clarity, appropriateness, and practicality.",
    "Assessment of the ability to perform language simulations reflecting cultural contexts (situational dialogues, role-plays) in a VR environment.",
    "Learners apply at least five universal design principles (WCAG 2.1 standards) to digital learning materials (PDFs, videos, web content, etc.), propose accessibility improvements (screen reader compatibility, color contrast adjustments, etc.), and submit a report (text and multimedia analysis) achieving over 80% suitability in peer reviews and expert evaluations."
