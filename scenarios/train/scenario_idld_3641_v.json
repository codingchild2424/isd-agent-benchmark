    "Over six months, learners engage in three or more collaborative problem-solving scenarios (e.g., interdisciplinary research design, educational policy development) via online discussion platforms (Padlet, Slack, etc.) and four in-person workshops, submitting final reports that incorporate peer evaluations (by ≥3 peers) and instructor feedback (rubric score ≥4/5) for each scenario.",
    "Learners use an LMS to independently establish learning plans and manage their progress.",
    "Learners apply knowledge acquired in a blended learning environment to complete a 4-week team project (policy proposal or digital storytelling) and submit deliverables that achieve ≥4 points per criterion (total ≥15/20) on an instructor and peer-assessment rubric (5 items: creativity, content fidelity, technology utilization, etc.)."
