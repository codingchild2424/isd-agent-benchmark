  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of basic scientific principles, familiarity with fundamental experiment design concepts, and foundational scientific writing/oral presentation skills",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Aims to strengthen scientific literacy and cultivate clear scientific language expression skills for elementary/in-service teachers. Emphasis on improving report writing and oral presentation skills when using lab simulations.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can identify and clearly explain, using scientific terminology, at least three types of errors that may occur during experimental design in a virtual laboratory.",
    "Learners apply critical thinking and linguistic expression skills necessary for the scientific inquiry process by critiquing peers' experimental designs.",
    "Based on their experimental critique experience, learners can accurately perform the scientific problem-solving process in a virtual laboratory environment with over 80% accuracy and systematically document it."
