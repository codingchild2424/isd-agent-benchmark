    "Acquisition of design explanation skills combining professional terminology and visual expression when utilizing metric scales and traditional color systems required in international project environments.",
    "Learners will derive three ethical design principles reflecting multicultural social contexts (cultural differences, language barriers, accessibility, etc.), create one design proposal applying them, and achieve at least 4 points (on a 5-point scale) in at least three out of four evaluation criteria (clarity, creativity, cultural appropriateness, technical accuracy) from an expert panel during a 10-minute presentation."
