  "learning_goals": [
    "Students can create and upload a 3-minute-or-less video explaining mathematical concepts to a discussion board.",
    "Learners can generate two or more higher-order thinking questions (analyzing, evaluating, and reconstructing) about peers' videos.",
    "Participants can submit reflective reports systematically reorganizing their mathematical thinking based on peer feedback."
