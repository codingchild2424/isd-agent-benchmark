    "Learners can complete at least 80% of self-directed learning modules (60 minutes per session, 5 times per week) in a mobile LMS environment.",
    "Learners can exchange peer feedback and complete two collaborative tasks via text/audio-based computer-mediated communication (CMC) without real-time video sessions.",
    "Learners can apply three contextually appropriate language learning strategies (e.g., noise mitigation) in real-world scenarios considering physical constraints of learning spaces."
