    "Learners can design STACK-based assessment items classified into three types",
    "Learners can understand and apply automated scoring algorithms for mathematical problem-solving",
    "Learners analyze five technical requirements (e.g., real-time feedback processing, item difficulty adjustment algorithms, LMS integration APIs) of a Computerized Adaptive Assessment (CAA) system within one week. They draft a requirements specification document and receive \"Met or Exceeded\" evaluations from ≥2 of 3 instructor/peer reviewers.",
    "Learners analyze ≥3 limitations of traditional assessment methods using CAA technology (e.g., automated scoring algorithms, adaptive item systems). They submit a hybrid assessment design addressing these within one week, achieving ≥3 points (5-point scale) in validity, feasibility, and innovativeness criteria."
