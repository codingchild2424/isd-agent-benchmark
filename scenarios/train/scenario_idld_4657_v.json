    "Learners collect three datasets related to workplace tasks using data analysis apps (Excel, Google Sheets, Datawrapper, etc.) on tablets/smartphones, perform mean/variance/correlation analysis, and generate two types of visualized charts (bar graph, scatter plot) for team sharing.",
    "In a 2-week team project (3–4 members), learners solve three math problems using digital collaboration tools (Google Jamboard, Miro, etc.), record the problem-solving process for each via screencast, and achieve ≥4 points (5-point scale) in peer-assessed knowledge-sharing effectiveness."
