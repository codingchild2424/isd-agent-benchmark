    "Collaborate with peer teachers to develop ≥2 customized instructional materials (step-by-step problem sets, concept visualization tools) reflecting learner needs.",
    "Trainees will generate monthly learner engagement and achievement reports using data collected from an online learning platform (LMS) (login frequency, quiz submission rate, video completion rate, problem-solving accuracy) and deliver personalized feedback messages (individual learning plans, error analysis) to the bottom 20% in engagement."
