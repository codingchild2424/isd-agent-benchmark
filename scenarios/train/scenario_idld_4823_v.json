    "Learners directly design and implement three science principle-based experiential activities for local middle school students.",
    "Learners identify at least two customer service issues in teams of 3–4 at a service-learning site (e.g., community event support), apply the scientific inquiry method (observation–hypothesis–experiment–conclusion) to propose solutions, and achieve a rating of \"average\" or higher in at least three out of five evaluation criteria (creativity, feasibility, collaborative attitude) based on peer and teacher assessments."
