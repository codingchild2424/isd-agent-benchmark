    "Enhance the accuracy of the four tones to over 90% using an AI pronunciation evaluation system",
    "Improve the naturalness of intonation and rhythm through repeated pronunciation practice (3 times weekly, 20+ minutes per session)",
    "Learners analyze pronunciation error patterns of ten or more individuals using AI-based speech analysis tools (e.g., Praat, SpeechRater), and based on frequency/severity evaluations by error type, establish personalized re-practice plans (including at least three strategies).",
    "Learners achieve ≥85% pronunciation accuracy in AI speech synthesis systems during monthly formal presentations (5-minute presentations) and daily conversation scenarios (10-minute dialogues) over six months, and earn an \"excellent\" grade in two out of three rubric criteria (pronunciation clarity, intonation naturalness, appropriate speed)."
