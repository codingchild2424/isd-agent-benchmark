    "additional_context": "A teaching competency enhancement program for pre-service or in-service teachers. Learners are university students aged 40+ with advanced language proficiency (grammar, vocabulary, reading, writing) who demand personalized learning experiences in BYOD environments. Project-based assessments evaluate real-life application skills (communication, writing, reading comprehension).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners analyze the six components of activity theory (subject, tools, rules, community, object, division of labor) in language learning contexts and design personalized environments to enhance vocabulary acquisition, grammar application, and communication skills.",
    "Learners use the four core elements of the PLDF framework (Profile, Learning, Design, Feedback) to design one integrated reading-writing content and one formative assessment strategy for each of three given learner profiles, and submit a report achieving an average of 4/5 points on peer and instructor feedback.",
    "Learners implement personalized learning paths that integrate digital tools (apps/platforms) to improve language learning outcomes (grammar accuracy, vocabulary diversity, fluency) by over 20%."
