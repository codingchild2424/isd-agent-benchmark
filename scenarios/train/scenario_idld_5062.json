    "Learners can solve complex workplace mathematical problems (e.g., budget analysis, statistical interpretation) using a four-step problem-solving process.",
    "Learners can self-diagnose their mastery level of mathematical skills into three stages (basic/intermediate/proficient) based on formative assessment feedback.",
    "Learners can achieve over 80% completeness and accuracy in project-based assessment tasks (e.g., department budget planning) by integrating peer evaluation and instructor feedback."
