    "Evaluate the ability to apply teaching strategies that transition elementary students' informal measurement concepts to formal measurement",
    "Learners can analyze three or more learning materials (PDFs, videos, quizzes) using smartphone-based accessibility measurement tools (e.g., WAVE, Lighthouse) in an online environment and develop a report that includes improvement plans meeting five WCAG 2.1 criteria."
