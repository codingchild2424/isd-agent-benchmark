    "Learners can develop blended learning materials (1 video of 5 minutes + 1 type of activity sheet) within a week, achieving an \"Excellent\" grade in 4 out of 5 rubric items during peer evaluation and expert review. (The activity sheet includes elements applicable to actual classes, such as math proofs, graph interpretation, and statistical analysis.)",
    "At the end of the 1-week short-term course, learners receive an individual comprehension analysis report through formative assessments (3 quizzes: equation solving, probability calculation, geometric proof / 1 practical assignment: creation of math concept visualization materials). If the correct answer rate is below 80%, they are provided with customized feedback (2 concept explanation videos + 5 supplementary questions: function graph interpretation, statistical data analysis, etc.)."
