    "Learners establish social presence using online discussion tools and engage in peer discussions on hypothesis formation and experimental design within the scientific inquiry process.",
    "Within one week, learners apply three strategies (e.g., reflective questioning, evidence-based reasoning, connective inference) to strengthen cognitive presence in three collaborative problem-solving tasks. They meet at least four out of five peer evaluation criteria in discussions and report writing, with emphasis on scientific rigor in variable control, data measurement, and result analysis.",
    "During a one-week graduate intensive course, learners interact at least three times with instructors and peers (via online forums, live discussions) and participate in a five-item feedback survey evaluating teaching presence. They provide specific feedback averaging over 3.5 on a 5-point scale per item, including suggestions for improving experimental protocols and analytical methodologies."
