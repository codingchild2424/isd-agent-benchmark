  "learning_goals": [
    "By applying the five phases of the ADDIE model (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation), learners can design UDL educational resources specialized for mathematics subjects",
    "Using the Innovation Diffusion Theory, learners can integrate core principles of the UDL framework into mathematics instruction",
    "Through project-based assessment, learners can develop UDL mathematics activity designs applicable in real classroom settings and incorporate peer feedback",
    "Pre- and post-self-assessment surveys can quantitatively measure changes in UDL comprehension and practical application abilities"
