    "prior_knowledge": "Understanding of fundamental trigonometric concepts (period, amplitude, phase), experience in advanced graph interpretation, and foundational knowledge of calculus",
    "duration": "Short-term intensive (within 1 week)",
    "learning_environment": "Mobile microlearning",
    "class_size": "Medium (10-30 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Learners study without spatiotemporal constraints using mobile devices, with daily 15-20 minute modules (graph analysis/equation-solving tasks). Real-time video sessions (2 sessions) focus on proof analysis, while asynchronous discussion boards share problem-solving strategies.",

  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Using dynamic visualization tools (e.g., graphing calculators), learners can explain the relationships between trigonometric function variables as equation inference steps on coordinate systems.",
    "Through a step-by-step task sequence (discrete data → continuous functions), learners progress in their ability to infer periodicity, amplitude, and phase shifts in trigonometric functions.",
    "Based on formative assessment feedback (problem-solving analysis), learners can reflect on and revise their reasoning processes (variable control, graph interpretation)."
