    "Utilize collaborative tools within the LMS to share experiences with peer learners at least once a week, developing practical problem-solving skills by applying scientific inquiry methods.",
    "After completing a 4-week virtual stretch assignment (challenging task), learners must propose two innovative solutions applicable to real scientific work environments (e.g., manufacturing/service sites), achieving an average of 4 or higher on a 5-point scale from peer/instructor feedback. The solution development must include experimental design and data analysis processes."
