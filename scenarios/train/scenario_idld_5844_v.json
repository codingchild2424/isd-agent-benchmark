    "Learners reduce communication latency between agents by 20% by applying selective decentralization strategies (e.g., dynamic routing, load balancing) within a 2–4 week process, and achieve a policy optimization success rate of 85% or higher in a simulation environment.",
    "Learners can analyze stability proof conditions for nonlinear system control using MDP-based dynamic programming.",
    "Learners write a comparative analysis report on performance metrics (processing speed, recovery time from failures, scalability) of fully decentralized, centralized, and selectively decentralized architectures within two weeks, and present three or more quantitative data points (e.g., 40% faster processing speed, 50% shorter recovery time) proving the superiority of selective decentralization."
