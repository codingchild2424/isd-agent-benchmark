  "learning_goals": [
    "Students can accurately interpret the basic structure of logical language (propositions, logical connectives, quantifiers) and apply it to mathematical proofs.",
    "Through team-based collaborative learning, students analyze the textual structure of complex mathematical problems, apply logical reasoning, and actively participate in the problem-solving process.",
    "Learners can mathematically model three real-world problems in computer engineering (e.g., algorithms, network optimization), implement the models in Python code to pass over 80% of test cases, and clearly explain the process in logical language."
