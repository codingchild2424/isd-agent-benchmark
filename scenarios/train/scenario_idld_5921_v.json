    "Over 2–4 weeks, learners collaborate with 3–5 team members while adhering to safety standards (e.g., school practicum safety manuals) and nature-based education principles (e.g., ecological sensitivity activities), drafting one health education activity plan and achieving ≥4/5 in peer and instructor rubrics (creativity, safety, nature integration, collaboration).",
    "Learners revise and improve their designed activities to over 80% completion through peer feedback and instructor evaluation."
