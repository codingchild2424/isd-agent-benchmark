  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can solve over 80% of mathematical problems encountered in game design through collaborative information-seeking strategies.",
    "Using the wiki LMS’s content and social features, learners can create and share team-based knowledge-building documents.",
    "Through problem-based learning, learners can apply mathematical concepts to actual game mechanics at least three times.",
    "In formative assessments, learners can perform self- and peer evaluations of collaborative problem-solving processes at least twice."
