    "Learners create smartphone-based digital learning objects (infographics, videos, etc.) explaining science concepts (e.g., ecosystem interactions, chemical reactions)",
    "Learners participate in formative assessment processes to improve their instructional design outputs via peer evaluation, validating the validity of the scientific inquiry process (hypothesis formulation-experiment design-data analysis-conclusion drawing)",
    "Using a teacher-provided PBL framework (e.g., 5-stage problem-solving process), learners design and execute ≥3 science problem-solving projects (e.g., environmental pollution measurement experiments, physics law application designs) over multiple cycles, submitting deliverables meeting ≥2 of 3 evaluation criteria per project (problem definition clarity, solution process systematicity, result validity)"
