    "Designing an online science inquiry course outline applying the four CEM methodology models (instructional, conceptual, interface, web).",
    "Learners develop 10-minute multimedia learning materials including three hypothesis-testing quizzes and one virtual lab simulation reflecting science domain characteristics (physics laws, chemical reactions, biological variables) and achieve 80+ points on an expert evaluation rubric (content accuracy 20%, interactivity 30%, scientific rigor 50%).",
    "Learners implement an LMS-compatible web prototype (navigation: ≤3-step paths, accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance) within 3 weeks, achieving ≥80% satisfaction in usability testing (5+ participants). The prototype must include experimental data visualization tools and scientific analysis features."
