  },
  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can write a software functional specification reflecting scientific needs for nursing continuing education.",
    "Learners can implement a prototype processing experimental/observational data for nursing education content by applying an LMS-based development process.",
    "Learners can complete a software development project in teams of three within five days using collaborative tools like GitHub and Trello in a BYOD environment, achieving over 80% implementation of functional requirements and scoring 3+ out of 5 on a peer evaluation rubric. This process applies scientific inquiry methods (hypothesis setting, variable control, data analysis, conclusion drawing)."
