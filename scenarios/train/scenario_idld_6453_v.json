    "Learners will reflect the five core principles of Andragogy (self-directedness, experience-based learning, etc.) to develop a 6-month self-directed learning plan, achieve ≥80% execution rate monthly, and document ≥3 reflective entries in a learning journal. Specifically, they will develop learning materials incorporating professional terminology and text structures from specialized fields (medical/legal/technical).",
    "Complete a real-world work environment simulation project using PBL and develop ≥5 evaluation criteria (e.g., metadata accuracy, terminology consistency, document readability, search efficiency, interdisciplinary applicability).",
    "Build a team-based metadata management system to improve collaboration efficiency by ≥20% (e.g., shared standardized glossary, cross-check protocols, feedback routines)."
