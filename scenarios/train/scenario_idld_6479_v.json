    "Learners will design lessons integrating theoretical knowledge and practical skills in a hands-on environment, including explanations of computer science terminology and concepts.",
    "Learners will improve language expression and explanation strategies through metacognitive reflection in the instructional design process.",
    "In teams of 3–4, learners will analyze two real classroom problems (e.g., low participation, learning gaps), derive one solution within a two-week collaborative project period, and achieve an \"excellent\" grade in at least two of three evaluation rubric items (problem definition clarity, solution feasibility, team contribution), utilizing clear communication and logical expression skills."
