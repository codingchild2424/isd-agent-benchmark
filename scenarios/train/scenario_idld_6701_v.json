  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners can design at least three self-directed language learning strategies (vocabulary expansion, text analysis, expression practice) for online environments.",
    "Learners phenomenologically analyze power dynamics and decision-making structures in online classes during the pandemic and explain how learner interaction patterns correlate with language learning effectiveness.",
    "Learners can explain procedures to validate assessment validity (grammar/vocabulary accuracy) and fairness (feedback consistency) when designing formative assessments using digital tools (Quizlet, Google Forms, etc.).",
    "To maintain work-life balance in online learning environments, learners implement a weekly study/rest plan at over 80% adherence and execute three personalized strategies (e.g., splitting study sessions, feedback routines, setting reading comprehension focus time) using time management tools (Notion, Google Calendar, etc.)."
