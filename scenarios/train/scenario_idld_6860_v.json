    "Enhancing 21st-century leadership competencies (communication, critical thinking, creativity) through blended virtual-real experiences.",
    "Learners can develop one project prototype related to a science field (e.g., environmental monitoring) within one week by applying the experiential learning cycle (action → reflection → improvement), and submit a final report reflecting three major improvement suggestions from peer evaluations and expert reviews."
