    "Learners can analyze redundancy across multiple information delivery modes (visual/auditory/text) and explain their impact on cognitive load",
    "Over three weeks, learners conduct a project evaluating the interaction between modular redundancy and codal redundancy through experimental design-based learning, and write a 5-page comparative efficiency report based on A/B test data. The report must meet three criteria: (1) comparison of three or more experimental conditions, (2) use of quantitative metrics (e.g., system uptime, error reduction rate), (3) inclusion of at least two HR process improvement proposals",
    "Learners apply Sweller’s Cognitive Load Theory to design information delivery strategies when developing corporate internal manuals/training materials and evaluate cognitive load for three or more work scenarios using NASA-TLX or similar measurement tools"
