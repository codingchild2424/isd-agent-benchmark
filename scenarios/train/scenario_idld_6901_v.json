    "Learners improve oral and written communication skills (pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar, discourse structure) by 30% through ABT activities based on real-world language scenarios (conversations, presentations, negotiations).",
    "Learners use LMS (e.g., Moodle, Blackboard) and e-learning content (videos, quizzes, text analysis tools) to select ≥3 weekly learning modules over 4 weeks, establish weekly plans (time allocation, goals, evaluation criteria), achieve ≥80% implementation, and submit weekly learning journals (200+ characters, <5% grammatical errors) on the LMS.",
    "Learners complete a 4-phase (planning-research-analysis-presentation) collaboration task with three team members using digital whiteboards (Miro, Jamboard) and video tools (Zoom, Microsoft Teams), achieving ‘excellent’ ratings in ≥4 of 5 peer evaluation rubric criteria (participation, creativity, language accuracy, teamwork, deliverable quality)."
