    "Learners can analyze problem cases occurring in actual math classes and design educational activities by applying a three-step problem-solving strategy (cause analysis–solution design–evaluation).",
    "Learners revise their problem-solving approaches based on peer feedback and implement over 80% of high-cognitive-level educational activities (e.g., creative problem-solving, metacognitive strategies).",
    "Learners can perform leadership roles in collaborative problem-solving processes with peer pre-service teachers using discussion facilitation strategies."
