    "Conduct a practical exercise comparing and connecting vocabulary usage patterns and text structures across three or more interdisciplinary fields using language analysis tools (e.g., corpus analysis software).",
    "Create a mutual learning journal based on conversation records with experts from other fields during real-time online discussions, including analysis of grammatical structures, discourse strategies, and non-verbal expressions."
