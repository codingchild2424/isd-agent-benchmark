  "learning_goals": [
    "Students will self-directly learn core physics concepts (e.g., kinematics, mechanics, conservation of energy) and reach at least 80% comprehension.",
    "Students will analyze physical phenomena using simulation tools provided in e-modules and submit experimental results in report form within 72 hours.",
    "Students measure their ability to apply learning content through module assessments and achieve a score of 75 or above (out of 100) in the summative evaluation."
