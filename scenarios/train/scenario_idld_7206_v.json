    "Learners analyze the step-by-step design process of authentication systems using various machine learning frameworks and understand text input data feature extraction methods",
    "Learners compare the impact of feature selection techniques (filter/wrapper-based) on authentication accuracy and analyze their correlation with lexical and syntactic characteristics of keystroke data",
    "Learners analyze given experimental data (e.g., accuracy, processing speed, error rate) to create a comparison table of three or more authentication algorithms (AES, RSA, SHA-256, etc.) and select the optimal algorithm based on presented evaluation criteria (security: 40%, efficiency: 30%, implementation ease: 30%). Additionally, they can interpret the analysis results from a linguistic perspective"
