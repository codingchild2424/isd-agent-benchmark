    "Learners record reflective thinking in an e-portfolio by project phase (planning-execution-evaluation) over six months, write a 500+ character reflective journal monthly across three dimensions (focus: clarity of mathematical modeling, inquiry: problem-solving algorithm design, change: conceptual growth awareness), receive feedback ≥3 times from an advisor, and achieve ≥4 points (5-point scale) in the final portfolio evaluation.",
    "Learners advance their thinking from a technical level (basic computation) to a dialogic-transformative level (mathematical proof and abstract thinking) through a four-stage reflective thinking process from lesson design to demonstration video production.",
    "Learners establish e-portfolio operation strategies to qualitatively enhance reflective thinking through peer feedback and self-assessment, particularly analyzing systematic mathematical approaches (e.g., differential equation applications) for physics problem-solving."
