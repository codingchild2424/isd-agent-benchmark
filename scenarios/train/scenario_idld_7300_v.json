    "Learners can reduce the damage rate to critical structures in the temporal bone (e.g., semicircular canals, stapes, facial nerve) by 30% after five training sessions.",
    "Learners can shorten goal-achievement time by 20% while relying on simulation tutor functions at or below 50%.",
    "Learners can independently determine the endpoint of surgery and achieve over 70% alignment between self-assessment and expert evaluation in the final assessment."
