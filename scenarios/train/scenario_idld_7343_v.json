    "Learners can analyze math-specific terminology (e.g., theorem, variable, proof) and complex sentence structures (conditional clauses, relative clauses) to extract core concepts.",
    "Learners can reduce translation dependency by ≥50% and practice reading methods based on mathematical context inference (e.g., equation-graph relationships, statistical data interpretation).",
    "Learners can reflect on their reading comprehension processes (especially mathematical argument structures) based on peer feedback and develop improvement plans."
