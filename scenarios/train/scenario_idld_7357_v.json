    "Learners can solve algebraic equations by converting them into physical manipulatives (e.g., algebra tiles) and digital simulations",
    "Learners propose creative solutions to three or more real-life problems by applying geometric/algebraic concepts to medical data analysis scenarios (e.g., tracking patient symptom patterns, calculating medication dosages) during a 4–6 week project-based assessment, and achieve an \"Excellent\" rating in at least four of the five evaluation rubric criteria (problem definition, mathematical modeling, feasibility, creativity, and result analysis)."
