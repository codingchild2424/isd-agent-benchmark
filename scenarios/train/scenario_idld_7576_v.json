    "Learners identify 3 accessibility barriers in science education environments (e.g., lack of lab tools, digital divide, language limitations) via online small-group discussions and propose solutions using scientific inquiry methods.",
    "Learners apply a relationship-centered discussion model (pair-squad debate) to draft a fair science class design framework reflecting multicultural learners’ backgrounds within 4 weeks, meeting ≥4 of 5 peer evaluation rubric items (experimental design, variable control, evidence-based conclusions).",
    "Learners revise ≥2 core elements (e.g., learning objectives, lab assessment methods, inquiry activities) of a science curriculum design based on ≥3 peer feedbacks and submit the revised draft meeting rubric criteria (clarity, feasibility, effectiveness) at ≥3 points (5-point scale)."
