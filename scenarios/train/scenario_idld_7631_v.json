    "Acquire learner diagnostic skills using spatial cognition measurement tools (spatial relations tests, mental rotation assessments)",
    "Learners can develop three lesson plans addressing 5th–6th grade geometry concepts (area, volume, angles) using IBL (Instructional-Based Learning) strategies, submitting designs meeting ≥4 of the 5 evaluation criteria from peer reviews and expert assessments."
