    "class_size": "Large (30+ learners)",
    "additional_context": "Project to develop and evaluate evidence-based practice (EBP) strategies in language education within smartphone-centric limited-technology environments. Focused on elementary/secondary classroom scenarios, with emphasis on verifying applicability in integrated language learning environments (reading-writing-listening-speaking).",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Systematically design an evidence-based practice (EBP) module for language education settings by applying the five stages of the ADDIE model (Analysis-Design-Development-Implementation-Evaluation)",
    "Learners can develop three evidence-based practice strategies applicable to real language education environments (elementary/secondary classroom scenarios) using Problem-Based Learning (PBL) within one week and submit a proposal meeting at least four of the five evaluation criteria (e.g., practicality, clarity of evidence, creativity, grammatical accuracy, learner engagement) provided in peer reviews and instructor feedback",
    "Learners can measure language education effectiveness in three areas—reaction (satisfaction survey), knowledge (vocabulary/grammar quiz), and behavioral change (communication behavior checklist)—using smartphone-based assessment tools (e.g., Google Forms, Kahoot!) and prepare a report meeting at least 80% achievement rate per area"
