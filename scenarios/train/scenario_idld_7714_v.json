  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners participate in 3+ online forum discussions applying language deepening strategies (e.g., question expansion, evidence presentation, multidimensional text analysis) and write critical thinking responses scoring an average of 4/5+ on the peer evaluation rubric (clarity, logic, creativity).",
    "Learners analyze group discussion structures and propose 3+ effective communication strategies (e.g., grammar structure utilization, vocabulary diversification, logical expression enhancement).",
    "Learners maintain 80%+ participation in VR-based simulation environments, achieving improvements in task completion and linguistic expressiveness."
