    "Learners analyze MOOC participants' learning motivation factors (social interaction, self-directed goals, external certification acquisition) and explain them within a social context.",
    "Learners compare the impact of gamification elements on learning immersion across cases of social relationship formation and civic engagement.",
    "Learners apply three core principles (accessibility, interactivity, modularity) when designing mobile-optimized microlearning content, produce one video or infographic under five minutes, and achieve an \"excellent\" rating in two or more of three peer-assessment rubric criteria (clarity, engagement, mobile suitability). Additionally, they enhance collaborative learning experiences through peer feedback exchanges during content creation."
