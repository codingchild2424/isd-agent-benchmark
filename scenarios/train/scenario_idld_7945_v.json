    "Explain blockchain core technologies (hash functions, consensus algorithms, distributed ledger) through card game mechanics, fostering the ability to articulate technical terms with clarity",
    "Learners design language learning motivation and sustained engagement strategies using three gamification elements (e.g., experience points, badges, leaderboards), submit strategies achieving an average of 4/5 or higher via peer evaluation, and demonstrate critical reading skills in feedback analysis",
    "Learners apply reinforcement learning (RL) exploration-exploitation balance strategies and reward shaping principles to design three game mechanics (e.g., scoring systems, level design, item drop rates), develop prototypes meeting ≥4 of 5 evaluation criteria (creativity, feasibility, learning effectiveness) through peer/teacher feedback, and enhance specialized vocabulary for technical documentation",
    "In 4-member team projects, learners develop one blockchain technology application case (smart contracts, distributed ledger) and submit deliverables (technical documentation, demo video, code repository), achieving ≥4 out of 5 rubric items (technical implementation, innovation, completeness, collaboration efficiency, presentation effectiveness) at 'B+' or higher, while applying effective expression strategies in presentations"
