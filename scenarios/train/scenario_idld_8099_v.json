    "Using an ontology-based search system, learners can accurately identify at least three core concepts (e.g., constructs, causal relationships) in behavioral research literature related to mathematics education.",
    "By analyzing relationships between theories extracted via the search system, learners can derive at least two actionable insights applicable to their project topic.",
    "Based on project outcomes, learners can evaluate the search system’s effectiveness in three aspects and propose improvement strategies."
