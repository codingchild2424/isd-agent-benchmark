  "context": {
    "prior_knowledge": "Advanced specialized knowledge and extensive practical experience in the field, basic communication skills (grammar, vocabulary, expression) and understanding of medical terminology required for patient observation",
    "duration": "Long-term course (1-6 months)",
    "learning_environment": "Online asynchronous (LMS)",
    "class_size": "Small (1-10 learners)",
    "additional_context": "Simulation-based program using digital devices to experience variables in patient observation tasks (e.g., nonverbal cues, linguistic misunderstandings) and non-repetitive assignments. Trains context-appropriate language expression and communication strategies",

  "learning_goals": [
    "Learners identify physical and emotional risk factors during patient behavior observation with over 80% accuracy and document them precisely using verbal and non-verbal expressions.",
    "Learners apply decision-making protocols to maintain patient safety in resource-limited environments and use structured communication techniques (e.g., SBAR) when collaborating with medical staff.",
    "Learners perform appropriate response procedures in three or more simulations for non-repetitive patient behaviors (e.g., self-harm attempts) and execute situation-specific verbal interventions.",
    "Learners systematically apply structured communication techniques (e.g., active listening, open-ended questions, empathetic responses) to ensure clear communication during collaboration with medical staff."
