  "learning_goals": [
    "Using the 6-stage CREATE model (Conceive-Research-Experimentate-Analyze-Try-Enhance), learners develop ≥2 functional packaging design prototypes and validate performance with scientific experimental data.",
    "Applying STEAM pedagogy, learners complete ≥1 package design integrating mathematical structures (e.g., geodesic dome geometry) and artistic elements, and analyze physical variables.",
    "Using smartphone-based digital tools (Canva, Figma mobile), learners create 3D renderings and angle variations of packaging prototypes, then optimize designs based on observational results."
