    "Perform object selection/manipulation tasks with 80% accuracy using a graphics-based interaction paradigm in a VR environment",
    "Implement three or more artistic styles (e.g., watercolor, sketch, ukiyo-e) in virtual spaces by applying non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) techniques",
    "Compare and evaluate interaction methods across six dimensions: learnability, accuracy, and user convenience based on experimental data analysis"
