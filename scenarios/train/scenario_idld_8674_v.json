    "Graduate students will create a 10-minute presentation incorporating complex sentence structures (conjunctions, relative clauses, participial phrases, etc.) to clearly articulate logical connections between experimental hypotheses, variables, and conclusions in scientific presentations and achieve ≥4 points (5-point scale) in the \"logical coherence\" category of peer evaluation rubrics.",
    "Use scientific terminology (e.g., variables, measurement, analysis, evidence) and grammatical structures with ≥70% accuracy during academic presentations.",
    "Demonstrate fluency (pruned speech rate) of ≥120 words per minute in professionally communicating experimental observations and scientific inquiry processes.",
    "Form self-directed learning habits with ≥85% feedback incorporation rate using mobile collaboration tools and improve scientific evidence-based presentation materials."
