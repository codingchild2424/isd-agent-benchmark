    "Learners will apply user interface and data visualization standards with over 80% accuracy when designing digital science textbooks and effectively represent scientific variables and experimental data.",
    "Learners will design interactive structures of science content using a meta-system approach and simulate hypothesis verification and evidence analysis processes.",
    "Learners will develop a digital science textbook prototype (minimum 5 pages) with three or more interactive elements (quizzes, videos, virtual lab simulations) using HTML5/CSS3 or open-source authoring tools (e.g., Booktype) in a 4-week project-based assessment and achieve an \"average\" or higher rating in four of five expert evaluation rubric items."
