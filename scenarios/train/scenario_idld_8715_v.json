    "Learners select at least three language learning courses from MOOC platforms like Coursera and edX, establish a weekly learning plan (including time, goals, vocabulary/grammar evaluation criteria), implement it for eight weeks with over 80% adherence, and write a 2,000-character self-assessment report reflecting their learning outcomes.",
    "Learners select three or more language-related micro-credentials (e.g., digital badges, online certification programs), analyze each credential’s components (learning content, assessment methods, issuing institution credibility), and design a customized certification pathway aligned with their learning needs. The designed pathway must achieve an \"Excellent\" rating in at least two of the three expert feedback rubric criteria: clarity, feasibility, and innovativeness. It must specifically include elements that enhance linguistic expression and reading comprehension skills.",
    "Through a project-based assessment (6-month course), learners design one or more language education contents applicable to real-world work environments (e.g., corporate training, online lecture platforms) and submit a final output that meets at least four of the five expert evaluation rubric criteria (e.g., practicality, creativity, educational effectiveness, text utilization, communication strategy)."
